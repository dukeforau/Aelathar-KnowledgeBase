The World of Aelathar
Geography
Aelathar is a vast, disc-shaped continent, a scarred and battered platter adrift in an often-tempestuous Outer Sea. Its very structure seems to echo the concentric shockwaves of the Veilshatter Cataclysm that defined its bleak destiny. From its turbulent outer waters to the terrifying epicenter of its devastation, Aelathar is a world of distinct, layered rings, each presenting unique challenges and horrors to those who dare to call it home or foolishly seek to traverse it.

The Outer Sea (The Endless Churn)

Encircling the entire disc of Aelathar is the Outer Sea, a vast and treacherous expanse of dark, turbulent waters.

Nature: Rarely calm, the sea is plagued by violent storms, rogue waves of immense size, and unnaturally strong currents that seem to pull ships towards unseen dooms or dash them against the jagged, unwelcoming coasts of the Salt Wastes. The water itself is often frigid, tasting bitterly of brine and something older, more unsettling – perhaps the dissolved sorrow of the world.
Mysteries & Dangers: Legends speak of colossal, unseen leviathans that dwell in its lightless depths, creatures that predate the Cataclysm or were born from its primal oceanic upheavals. Ghostly lights are sometimes seen dancing on the waves far from shore, luring sailors to their doom, and unnatural fogs can descend without warning, disorienting even the most experienced navigators. Few dare to sail far from Aelathar’s shores, and even fewer return. The Cradle Sea, a vast subterranean ocean, is rumored to have hidden, perilous connections to this Outer Sea in the deepest underwater trenches.
Inhabitants: Only the most desperate or uniquely adapted coastal communities (perhaps hardy human fisherfolk, some Drow enclaves if they have access, or followers of Vorath or Lyria) interact with it regularly, and always with a deep, abiding fear.
The Salt Wastes (The Desiccated Ring)

The first terrestrial ring forming the "crust" of Aelathar is the immense and arid Salt Wastes.

Nature: Stretching for countless leagues, these seemingly endless salt flats glitter cruelly under the harsh sun, a white, cracked expanse that offers little life and even less hope. The silence here is profound, broken only by the crunch of salt underfoot and the mournful whistling of the wind that carries fine, stinging salt particles. What little water can be found is often hypersaline or tainted.
Magical Infusion & Perils: A direct consequence of the Veilshatter Cataclysm, the Salt Wastes were formed as rivers boiled away and fertile soil turned to dust, leaving behind vast salt deposits deeply infused with residual, chaotic magical energy. These salts sometimes shimmer with faint, sickly colors (greens, purples, bruised twilight hues). Prolonged exposure is not only inhospitable but actively dangerous, leading to severe dehydration, madness, salt-encrusted mutations, and encounters with salt-cryst creatures like the Salt-Cryst Stalker. Mirages are common, often imbued with Veil energy, whispering lies or showing tantalizing glimpses of impossible oases.
Inhabitants: Only the hardiest Human or Orcish nomadic tribes traverse its deeper sections, possessing secret ways to find brackish water or navigate by subtle salt patterns. Mining colonies, primarily of Dwarves and Humans, cling to the more stable inner edges of this ring, where it borders the Inhabitable Lands, seeking rare minerals amidst the desolation. Korrath, the Iron Bastion, is situated in the defensible foothills where the Salt Wastes begin to transition.
The Inhabitable Lands (The Ring of Stolen Life)

Beyond the Salt Wastes lies a vast, diverse, and deeply scarred ring that constitutes the "inhabitable" lands of Aelathar – though "habitable" is a grimly relative term here. This is not a uniform paradise, but rather a collection of distinct, often treacherous regions where life, scarred and warped, still clings to existence. The great cities of Aelathar (excluding Zyndralis, which lies further inward) are found within this ring, each adapted to its specific territory.

Nature: This ring is a mosaic of the major biomes previously detailed, now understood as sectors or vast territories within this larger band:
The Ashen Peaks (Western Sector): A formidable range of jagged, volcanic mountains, perpetually shrouded in sulfurous smoke and ash. Rivers of molten lava flow, and the ground trembles with geothermal activity. This is where Orrthar, the City of Embers, thrives, built within the volcanic terrain.
The Veiljungles (Southern Sector): A surprisingly resilient, albeit corrupted, rainforest, a riot of unnatural colors and twisted flora and fauna infused with raw Veil magic. Eerie lights, strange blossoms, and an atmosphere thick with humidity and unseen life define it. Iravar, the Verdant Heart, is nestled within this dangerous beauty.
The Glass Expanse (Eastern Sector): A chillingly beautiful yet deadly plain of razor-sharp obsidian, fused by unimaginable magical fires. Its reflective surface can be blinding, offering no cover. Few permanent settlements exist here, though the Charred Halls (temple-forges of Theramach) might lie on its volatile border.
The Scorched Plains (Northern and Central parts of this Ring): Large swathes of this ring consist of arid plains, rocky badlands, and desolate valleys baked by the sun and scoured by harsh winds. These areas are less defined by a single feature like volcanoes or jungles but are nonetheless harsh and dangerous. It is within these more open, though still perilous, territories that cities like Korrath (bordering the Salt Wastes and near the Ashen Peaks' foothills) have carved out their existence.
Inhabitants: This ring holds the bulk of Aelathar's population, with each race and culture (excluding those primarily in Zyndralis) finding niches within its varied territories and major cities.

\page

The Shimmering Sands (The Unstable Expanse)

Encircling the dreadful Af'Ath'Ki, the Shimmering Sands form a vast, treacherous desert—a chaotic and magically radioactive wasteland that serves as a horrifying testament to the energies unleashed by the Veilshatter Cataclysm. This is the primary barrier before one can even glimpse the ultimate devastation at the continent's heart.

Nature: A vast, circular desert of eternally swirling, magically charged sands. These sands constantly shift in color – from blinding gold to sickly violet, to blood red, and back again – reflecting the unstable Veil energies that permeate this accursed place. Perpetual, localized Veilstorms are common here, appearing and disappearing with little warning, far more frequent and intense than in the outer rings. The air crackles with raw, unpredictable energy, and visibility is often near zero. The ground can sometimes fuse into temporary, beautiful yet fragile glass-like formations due to intense magical discharges.
Dangers: Beyond the constant Veilstorms and magical radiation, the Shimmering Sands are home to unique and deadly Veil-touched creatures (like Shifting Motes), elementals of pure chaotic energy, and perhaps the maddened remnants of those who sought power here and were consumed by it. The very sands can strip flesh from bone or imbue travelers with strange magical afflictions or severe Crystallization. The disorienting sensory input, with strange lights and distorted whispers, can lead to paranoia and madness.
Inhabitants & Outposts: Only the most powerful mages from Zyndralis, desperate seekers of forbidden lore, fanatical cultists, or uniquely adapted creatures dare to venture deep into the Shimmering Sands. Not far from its inner edge, bordering Af'Ath'Ki, are the outposts of Zyndralis. These function as both guard posts against abominations from the Shimmering Sands and precarious safe havens for those attempting to cross this limbo. A number of scholars always reside in these locations, studying the effects of the Black Spire and the oddities of the Shimmering Sands.

\page

Af’Ath’Ki (Elvish for "Ring of Nil" - The Annihilated Heart)

This is the ring surrounding the Black Spire, the ground zero of the Veilshatter Cataclysm. Nothing grows in close proximity to the Spire. A mystic sort of energy seems to draw life, sound, and light from anything getting within 200-300 feet of the Spire itself. Scholars have yet to discern what or how this is happening. All that is known is that no one can stay close to the tower over time without being impacted by the curse of the Veil; for every hour spent within this close proximity, a creature must make a roll on the Veil Corruption table. However, instead of turning into a typical Veil-infested NPC, people and beasts enveloped and consumed by the Veil here turn into obsidian statues. Numerous statues of various beings circle the Spire, testaments to those who tempted fate to try and learn its secrets.

Not even the Obsidian beasts of the Glass Expanse or the other Veil-infested inhabitants of Aelathar typically live within Af’Ath’Ki due to its profoundly inimical nature. There is no known cure, magical or otherwise, for the obsidian transformation. Many clerics, druids, and arcane users have tried all known spells and tricks to revert this, but with no luck.

The Black Spire: Dominating the center of Af’Ath’Ki is the Black Spire. A colossal, monolithic column of pure, unblemished obsidian, it pierces the sky like a shard of frozen night. It seems to absorb all light and sound around its immediate base and radiates an aura of immense, ancient power, dread, and a subtle, unnerving hum that can be felt deep within one's bones. It is believed to be the ultimate focal point of the Cataclysm.
Strange Magic: Magic behaves weirdly the closer one gets to the tower, starting at about 500 feet from the Spire. Within this radius, casters may need to roll on a special Veil magic table (found in the magic chapter of this book).
Dimensions & Quadrants: Af’Ath’Ki is approximately 5 miles across at its widest point and 2 miles at its narrowest, surrounding the Spire. It is sometimes conceptually divided into regional quadrants: the East is known as Zynara (where Zyndralis is situated), the South as IRAVAR (note: distinct from the city of Iravar which is in the Veiljungles), the West as Aniolith, and the North as Aslabeth. These quadrants may have subtle differences in their desolate makeup or the intensity of the Spire's influence.
Outposts of Zyndralis: As mentioned, Zyndralis maintains eight permanently manned outposts ringing Af'Ath'Ki, two in each quadrant (Zynara, IRAVAR, Aniolith, Aslabeth). These serve as vital monitoring stations and perilous forward research bases. In addition, each quadrant has 2-4 more infrequently used, but maintained, outposts for emergencies or special expeditions.
Zyndralis (The Spire City, The Obsidian Oracle)

Region: Zynara Region (the eastern quadrant of Af’Ath’Ki’s outer perimeter, or the region just beyond it).
Location: On the eastern edge of Af’Ath’Ki, about 5 miles from the Black Spire itself, and close to the inner edge of The Shimmering Sands. It seems to be placed on the point of Af'Ath'Ki where it is furthest from the Spire but also then closest to where this ring is narrowest, offering perhaps a slightly more "stable" (a highly relative term) access point or observation area.
Description: Mystical and unsettling city, center for arcane study, Veil research, forbidden lore, and obsidian mining. Ruled by the monastic Council of the Obsidian Circle. Magic is heavily monitored. Newer parts of the city are constructed from obsidian mined from the Glass Expanse, while older sections might incorporate the strange, dark stone of the region itself.
Dominant Deities: Voryx (Knowledge, Arcana, Order), Nyraea (Magic, Fate, Secrets), with undertones of Azryth (Secrets) and Lunaria (Moon, Illusion).
Likely Inhabitants & Racial Tendencies:
High Elves: Significant population, perhaps the scholarly elite. Their arcane aptitude and long lifespans suit the study of the Veil and the Black Spire. Key figures in Veilwardens (researchers) or Voryx's Shardbound.
Humans: Significant population. Drawn by ambition, arcane curiosity, or the Spire's secrets, despite the risks. Form a large part of the student body, support staff, and even some monastic orders.
Gnomes (Forest/Arcane): Notable minority. Their curiosity and aptitude for illusion/subtle magic draw them to study the Veil, Nyraea's secrets, or Lunaria's mysteries.
Tieflings: Notable presence. Drawn to study their own arcane heritage (Nyraea, Voryx) or operate in the city's shadowy undercurrents (Azryth). The city's acceptance of the arcane (albeit monitored) might be more welcoming than Korrath.
Dragonborn (Voryxian Atoners): Notable presence. Scholars and monks dedicated to understanding the Veil and Voryx's legacy.
Veilkin: Significant, though often hidden or segregated, population. Zyndralis is a place where their condition is most likely to be studied or arise. Some might be part of the monastic orders, seeking control or understanding.
Drow: Minority, often operating in shadows or hidden enclaves near the Black Spire. Studying dark energies, information brokering, serving Azryth, or delving into forbidden Veil aspects.
Aasimar: Rare. Might be here seeking to understand the divine tragedy, their own celestial heritage in context of the Veil, or to counter particularly dangerous magical threats.
Dwarves, Halflings, Orcs, Goliaths, Stone-Scales: Less common, but individuals with scholarly aptitude, a desire for arcane knowledge, or specific skills (like obsidian shaping for dwarves) could be present.

\page

The Ashen Peaks (Northwestern Sector of the Inhabitable Lands)
Dominating the northwestern portion of Aelathar's "Inhabitable Lands" ring is the formidable mountain range known as the Ashen Peaks. This is a chain of jagged, volcanic mountains, perpetually shrouded in sulfurous smoke and acrid ash that chokes the unprepared and stains the sky with a permanent, hazy twilight. The very ground often trembles with intense geothermal activity, a constant reminder of the raw, untamed power seething beneath the crust. Rivers of molten lava, like fiery serpents, carve glowing paths down the mountainsides and through desolate valleys, their heat creating shimmering, disorienting air currents. The terrain is treacherous and unstable, with sudden chasms, fields of razor-sharp volcanic rock, and crumbling slopes making every step a gamble. The air hangs thick and heavy, carrying the pungent smell of brimstone, heated rock, and metallic fumes.

To their north and west, the volcanic rocks and tormented landscapes of the Ashen Peaks give way abruptly to the desolate expanse of The Salt Wastes, creating a stark and inhospitable border. While the range boasts many colossal, dormant calderas and steaming fissures, only two major volcanoes are still considered active, though their fury seems to be a pale echo of past eruptions. From these two peaks, known to the denizens of Orrthar as Mount Kaelag and Mount Therum, a steady but slow stream of incandescent lava crawls forth, feeding three primary lava rivers that meander through the lower valleys, shaping the landscape and serving as both a resource and a constant danger.

Much of the Ashen Peaks remains a wild, mostly uninhabited wilderness. These desolate highlands and smoke-filled canyons are home to strange, elemental-like creatures born of fire, smoke, and stone – from skittering Magma Mephits and lumbering Smoke Paraelementals to more enigmatic beings that seem to be living manifestations of geothermal vents. Rumors persist among prospectors and brave explorers of "stones that move" – perhaps resilient Earth Elementals, ancient Galeb Duhr awakening from millennia of slumber, or even illusions born from the disorienting heat haze and volcanic gases.

The entire region is known as the Talrova Region, a name that evokes both its fiery nature and the resilient spirit of its primary inhabitants. Life here is a constant struggle against the elements and the often-hostile native creatures, but the mountains are also rich in mineral veins, rare crystals, and geothermal power, drawing those hardy enough to exploit them.

Not far from the jagged border of a vast, desolate caldera known locally as Urngor Eigur (a place even the denizens of Orrthar treat with caution), and situated on the easternmost edge of the Ashen Peaks where the volcanic foothills begin to descend towards a particularly barren and magically scarred stretch of wastelands that some call the "Cinder Marches" (which themselves eventually lead towards the more central, perilous Shimmering Sands), lies the only major bastion of civilization in this volatile domain:

\page

Orrthar (The City of Embers, The Sky-Forge)

Region: Talrova Region (within the Ashen Peaks)
Description: Orrthar stands as a marvel of engineering and raw determination, a city literally carved into and built amidst the active volcanic terrain of the Ashen Peaks. Its structures often incorporate the dark volcanic rock, reinforced with metals wrested from the mountains themselves. Great forges, powered by harnessed geothermal vents, burn day and night, their smoke mingling with the volcanic haze that perpetually hangs over the city. These vents also provide heat and a rudimentary form of power for many of the city's mechanisms. Known throughout Aelathar for its unparalleled innovation in metallurgy, smithing, and harnessing primal energies, Orrthar is a city of roaring fires, clanging hammers, and the constant, faint tremor of the earth. It is a beacon of fierce creation in one of Aelathar's most hostile environments.
Dominant Deities: Theramach (Fire, Passion, Creation) is widely revered, his fiery spirit seen in every forge and volcanic eruption. Kaelgrin (Earth, Endurance) is honored for the mountain's bounty and the strength needed to endure its harshness. Orren (Craft, Invention) is the patron of the city's countless artisans, smiths, and engineers.
Likely Inhabitants & Racial Tendencies:
Dwarves: Core population. Master smiths, engineers, miners, forming the backbone of the Pyric Assembly (Orrthar's ruling council of guilds and clan elders). Devout followers of Kaelgrin and Orren, many embracing Theramach's fire in their forges.
Humans: Significant population. Key contributors to industry, engineering, and as artisans. Followers of Theramach or Kaelgrin, their adaptability allowing them to thrive even here.
Goliaths (especially Forgestruck): Significant minority. Drawn by Theramach's power and contribute their strength to industry and defense. May have some tension with Kaelgrin-devoted Goliaths from more remote mountain tribes who are wary of Orrthar's extensive mining.
Gnomes (Rock): Notable minority. Highly prized for inventive genius, working alongside dwarves on intricate mechanisms, geothermal systems, and alchemical innovations. Followers of Orren or Theramach.
Dragonborn: Notable presence. Wyrmscorned or Unbound Dragonborn drawn by Theramach's power or the city's practical industriousness. Fire-aspected Dragonborn, in particular, find a kinship with the city's fiery heart.
Orcs: Minority, often integrated. Valued for their strength as laborers in the mines and forges, or as powerful warriors in the city guard, especially those who revere Theramach's passionate might.
Tieflings (Infernal/Fire-aspected): Notable minority. May find acceptance or even reverence among followers of Theramach due to their fiery lineage or arcane talents, which are often directed towards pyromancy or elemental binding.
Stone-Scales: Rare individuals. Their inherent strength and resilience could be valued in the demanding labor of the city, and those with Fire Titan echoes in their mixed heritage might align with Theramach.
Elves, Halflings: Less common. The intense industrial and fiery environment is not their typical preference, though some artisans, traders, or those seeking unique crafted goods could be present.
Aasimar: Very rare. Perhaps drawn by a divine calling to temper the city's more destructive or exploitative tendencies, or to inspire true, passion-fueled creativity that serves a greater good.

Aelathar, the Scorched Cradle
to be used with 5th Edition systems

<br>
<br>
<br>


I. Overview

Core Concept & Tone

Aelathar, often grimly referred to as the "Scorched Cradle," is a world fundamentally scarred by an ancient, divine calamity. Once a realm of lush vibrancy and harmonious creation, it was sundered by a cataclysmic war between celestial dragons and elemental titans. This conflict culminated in the Veilshatter Cataclysm, an event that ravaged the landscape, leaving behind a sun-scorched desertscape punctuated by the haunting remnants of its former glory. The very air in many places tastes of dust and ancient sorrow.

Magic, intrinsically linked to and corrupted by this cataclysm through the fractured Veil between realities, is a potent yet perilous force. It sustains what little life clings to existence but exacts a harsh toll on those who dare to wield its arcane aspects. Aelathar blends the stark, survivalist themes reminiscent of settings like Dark Sun with the epic narrative potential and mythic deities found in sagas like Dragonlance. The struggle for basic resources is constant, yet whispers of lost glory and the potential for a new future drive many to heroism or desperation.

Inspirations

Dark Sun: Harsh survival, resource scarcity, powerful psionics (could be an alternative to Veil magic or another force), environmental dangers, potent but dangerous magic, city-states with unique cultures.
Dragonlance: Epic conflicts, mythic deities actively (or passively) influencing the world, ancient history shaping the present, narrative-driven world events, the balance between order and chaos.

Aelathar is a vast desert world shattered by divine war, where life clings precariously to existence through the perilous use of its corrupted magic.

The World of Aelathar

Geography

The heart of Aelathar is the Scorched Cradle, a vast and unforgiving desert that serves as the epicenter of the ancient cataclysm's devastation. The sun beats down relentlessly, and the nights offer little respite, often bringing biting cold. This central wasteland is bordered by diverse, yet equally treacherous, regions:

<br>

The Ashen Peaks (West):
A formidable range of jagged, volcanic mountains, perpetually shrouded in sulfurous smoke and ash that chokes the unprepared. The ground trembles with geothermal activity, with rivers of molten lava flowing like fiery serpents and treacherous, unstable terrain making every step a gamble. The air is thick with the smell of brimstone and heated rock.

The Glass Expanse (East):
A chillingly beautiful yet deadly plain of razor-sharp obsidian, fused into existence by unimaginable magical fires during the War of Sundering. Its reflective surface can be blinding during the day, and the landscape offers no cover. The wind howls across its sharp edges, creating an eerie, mournful music. Stepping on it feels like walking on a field of broken, black mirrors.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page

The Salt Wastes (North):
Arid, seemingly endless salt flats stretch across the northern territories, glittering cruelly under the harsh sun. The silence here is profound, broken only by the crunch of salt underfoot and the whistling wind.
Formation and Magical Infusion: The Salt Wastes are a direct consequence of the Veilshatter Cataclysm. The shattering of the Heart of Creation unleashed elemental and magical chaos that obliterated natural cycles. Rivers boiled away, fertile soil turned to dust, and vast areas became encrusted with salt as water evaporated under the cataclysm's intense heat. The remaining salts are deeply infused with residual magical energy, shimmering with faint, sickly colors. Prolonged exposure is not only inhospitable but actively dangerous, leading to dehydration, madness, and mutations.
Symbolic Role and Perils: The Wastes stand as a stark, glittering monument to the cost of unchecked power. They act as both a formidable physical and thematic barrier to exploration and settlement, ensuring that travel and trade routes across them are perilous undertakings, fraught with magical hazards, mirages that whisper lies, and salt-encrusted monstrosities. They also form a natural, hostile divide between major factions and regions of Aelathar.

The Veiljungles (South):

A surprisingly resilient, albeit corrupted, rainforest clings precariously to life in the southern reaches, a riot of unnatural colors and twisted forms. This jungle is infused with raw magic from the Veil, resulting in mutated flora that glows with eerie light, fauna with extra limbs or unsettling intelligence, and an atmosphere thick with humidity, the scent of strange blossoms, and the buzz of unseen insects. The very air feels alive and watchful.

\column

Key Landmarks

The Black Spire: A colossal, monolithic spire of pure, unblemished obsidian that juts from the desert's heart, piercing the sky like a shard of frozen night. It seems to absorb all light and sound around its base. Rumored to be the colossal impact point of a fallen god or the petrified heart of a slain titan, it radiates an aura of immense, ancient power, dread, and a subtle, unnerving hum that can be felt in one's bones.
The Cradle Sea: A vast, subterranean saltwater ocean hidden deep beneath the Scorched Cradle, accessible only through perilous, labyrinthine cave systems often guarded by desperate communities or monstrous creatures. It is home to unique bioluminescent ecosystems, bizarre aquatic life adapted to darkness and saline conditions, and perhaps even hidden, forgotten civilizations that escaped the Cataclysm. The air in these caverns is cool, damp, and smells of brine and ancient stone.
The Shimmering Sands: A particular region within the Scorched Cradle known for its perpetual, magically charged sandstorms. The air crackles with raw, unpredictable energy, and the sands themselves shift in color, from gold to violet to blood red, sometimes coalescing into temporary glass-like formations or spectral figures. Visibility is often near zero, and the storms can strip flesh from bone or imbue travelers with strange magical afflictions.

III. History of Aelathar

The Age of Verdant Harmony

In the dawn of time, Aelathar was a world of unparalleled bounty and lushness. Elemental titans, the very architects of nature – beings of stone, fire, water, and air – worked in a delicate, creative harmony with the celestial dragons, majestic custodians of cosmic order and nascent magic. Together, they cultivated a paradise where the first mortal races flourished under their joint guidance. The titans sculpted mountains that touched the clouds, carved meandering rivers that sang through verdant valleys, and nurtured sprawling jungles teeming with life. The dragons, in turn, brought the concepts of law, intellect, structured society, and the first understanding of the magical weave to the burgeoning civilizations.

The Seeds of Discord

This primordial balance, however, proved fragile. The titans, beings of boundless creation and inherent destructive potential, grew increasingly resentful of the celestial dragons' rigid laws and adherence to order, perceiving them as stifling constraints upon their elemental freedom and the raw expression of their creative impulses. Conversely, the dragons viewed the titans' unchecked, often chaotic creativity as reckless and a grave danger to the very stability they had painstakingly instilled in the world, fearing the unraveling of the delicate magical and ecological systems.

Tensions reached a critical point when Voryx, the Shattered Wyrm, a powerful and influential celestial dragon known for his wisdom and foresight, proposed an audacious plan: to seal or otherwise contain the Heart of Creation. This primordial wellspring of raw elemental power was revered and directly controlled by the titans, and Voryx believed its unbound, volatile energy would inevitably lead to Aelathar's eventual destruction or corruption. In furious retaliation against this perceived sacrilege and existential threat to their power and essence, the titan Theramach the Everflame, a being of incandescent rage and unyielding will, led a devastating assault on the dragons' sacred sanctuaries among the highest peaks, igniting the divine conflict that would irrevocably define Aelathar’s destiny.

The War of Sundering

For uncounted centuries, the celestial dragons and elemental titans waged a war of truly apocalyptic scale. The skies above Aelathar burned with draconic fire and elemental fury as titanic avatars clashed in earth-shattering confrontations that reshaped continents. The very fabric of the land was torn asunder, mountains were leveled, seas boiled, and new, terrible landscapes were forged in the crucible of their divine wrath. Mortals, caught in the devastating crossfire of this divine struggle, were forced to choose allegiances, their fledgling civilizations often shattered in the process. Some turned to the worship of the dragons, valuing their promise of order and wisdom amidst the chaos, while others venerated the raw power and creative, if destructive, spirit of the titans. Many more simply perished.

The Veilshatter Cataclysm

The seemingly endless War of Sundering culminated in a single, catastrophic event that would forever be known as the Veilshatter Cataclysm. At the volatile Heart of Creation, now a battleground scarred beyond recognition, Voryx and Theramach met for their final, desperate confrontation. In a last, cataclysmic bid to end the conflict and perhaps contain the Heart's spiraling chaotic power, Voryx unleashed the Veilrend—a forbidden, ancient spell of immense power, drawn from the deepest secrets of cosmic architecture, designed to tear open the very barrier between the material world and the chaotic, formless void that lay beyond, hoping to banish or neutralize the Heart's destructive potential.

The resulting explosion was beyond comprehension. It annihilated both Voryx and Theramach, their divine essences shattered and scattered like dust across the dying world. The Heart of Creation itself shattered into countless fragments, unleashing a torrent of raw, untamed magic and elemental chaos across the entirety of Aelathar. The Veil, the metaphysical membrane separating realities and regulating the flow of magic, was catastrophically torn, shredded into a fragile, unstable lattice.

The Age of Scorching

The Veilshatter Cataclysm marked the pyrrhic end of the War of Sundering, but it came at an unfathomable, world-altering cost. The once-lush lands of Aelathar were scoured, flash-boiled, and transformed into desolate, sun-baked wastelands under a sky choked with ash and strange lights. The Veil, once a stable and protective barrier, became a fractured, dangerously thin membrane, barely holding reality together against the encroaching chaos of the outer void.

Magical storms, known as Veilstorms, became a terrifyingly common occurrence, sweeping across the land, further warping the terrain and its unfortunate inhabitants with unpredictable mutations, temporal distortions, and raw chaotic energies. The surviving celestial dragons, their power severely weakened, their numbers decimated, and their pride broken, withdrew from the world in shame and sorrow, scattering to hidden refuges or fading into myth. The surviving elemental titans, their own might shattered and their physical forms often broken, fell into deep, earth-shattering slumbers, buried deep within the planet's core or imprisoned within magically-scarred landscapes.

Mortals, now largely abandoned by their divine patrons and stripped of their established civilizations, were left to fend for themselves in this harsh, unforgiving new reality. Magic became both an essential tool for survival and a dangerous, corrupting burden, as its very use—especially arcane magic drawn from the damaged Veil—threatened to further destabilize the fragile fabric of existence. From the ashes and dust of the old world, new, hardened cultures and desperate settlements slowly began to emerge, each irrevocably shaped and scarred by the lingering trauma and harsh lessons of the Cataclysm.

Peoples of a Scarred World
The lands of Aelathar, the Scorched Cradle, are trod by peoples both familiar and uniquely forged in its unforgiving crucible. Ages of divine warfare, the cataclysmic Veilshatter, and the relentless struggle for survival under a sun that bakes and a magic that corrupts have left indelible marks upon all who call this blighted world home.

<br>

You will find echoes of the so-called "common" folk of other realms here – Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and their kin still draw breath upon Aelathar. Millennia of hardship have not, for the most part, drastically reshaped their fundamental forms; an Elf still bears the grace of their ancient lineage, a Dwarf the sturdy resilience of stone. Yet, to assume their hearts and minds remain untouched by the horrors and wonders of Aelathar would be a grave misjudgment. While their physical nature might mirror those of distant worlds, their cultures, their beliefs, their very behaviors have been warped, hardened, and reforged by generations of strife. The discipline of a Korrathi human, the desperate hope of an Iravar halfling, the arcane obsession of a Zyndralis elf – these are adaptations born of necessity, testaments to the enduring spirit of mortals clinging to existence in a world that actively seeks to unravel them.

<br>

But the cruel environment and the profound, scarring history of Aelathar have done more than just mold the old. The volatile energies of the shattered Veil, the lingering echoes of titanic power, and the sheer, brutal pressure to adapt or perish have, over the long and desperate Age of Scorching, given rise to new players on this desolate stage. These are not mere offshoots or variations, but distinct peoples whose very essence is a product of the Scorched Cradle.

<br>

Among them, you might encounter the Stone-Scales, rare and solitary wanderers bearing the conflicted heritage of Dragonborn might and Goliath endurance, forever caught between the legacies of a shattered sky and slumbering earth. Or perhaps your path will cross that of the Veilkin, humanoids of elven and human-like grace whose forms are an unsettling canvas for the Veil's chaotic artistry, each individual a testament to life's precarious dance with corrupted magic, some even finding a strange resilience or a flicker of hope within their warped existence.

<br>

This chapter delves into the peoples who inhabit Aelathar, exploring how the familiar have been changed by its trials, and introducing those born uniquely of its sorrow and its magic. For in the Scorched Cradle, survival itself is an evolution, and every soul is a story etched in dust and defiance.


\column

Humans:

Place in Aelathar: Humans are the ubiquitous survivors, found in every corner of Aelathar, from the sprawling (if perilous) streets of its few cities to nomadic bands in the Scorched Cradle and isolated survivor enclaves. They form a significant, if not majority, population in:
Korrath: Many humans here are drawn by the promise of Saevyr's order or the pragmatic need for security, forming the bulk of the citizenry and guard.
Orrthar: Human ingenuity and adaptability make them key contributors to the city's industry and engineering, often found in mining guilds (Kaelgrin) or as passionate artisans (Theramach).
Iravar: Those seeking refuge or a life closer to nature might find a place here, though they would need to deeply respect the Verdant Conclave's ways and Eryssia's tenets.
Zyndralis: Human ambition, curiosity for the arcane (Voryx, Nyraea), or the allure of the Black Spire's secrets would draw many, despite the risks.

Cultural Adaptations: Extremely varied. Desert nomads would have traditions focused on water preservation and navigating by the strange celestial lights. City-dwellers would adopt the specific cultural norms of their chosen settlement—militaristic in Korrath, industrious in Orrthar, nature-revering in Iravar, and arcane-focused in Zyndralis. The constant struggle for resources and the threat of Veil magic would make most human societies pragmatic and resilient.

Deities: All deities would find human worshippers. Their adaptability means they connect with the full spectrum of divine expression in Aelathar.

Elves: 
High Elves:

Place in Aelathar: Predominantly found in Zyndralis, where their innate arcane aptitude and long lifespans are suited to the study of the Veil, the Black Spire, and the pursuit of Voryx's knowledge or Nyraea's secrets. Some might lead secluded academies or libraries. A few might be found in Iravar if their focus is on understanding or preserving the magical aspects of the Veiljungles.

Cultural Adaptations: Zyndralis High Elves would be scholarly, perhaps somewhat detached, and deeply aware of the dangers of Veil magic. They might be key figures in the Veilwardens (as researchers) or Shardbound. Their culture would emphasize careful study, precision in magic, and the preservation of lore from before the Cataclysm.

<br>

Wood Elves:
Place in Aelathar: Primarily in and around Iravar and the less corrupted fringes of the Veiljungles. Some may form isolated communities in any pocket of resilient nature, like hidden oases or remote canyons in the Ashen Peaks' foothills.

Cultural Adaptations: Deeply connected to Eryssia, they would be fierce protectors of the remaining natural world. Their survival skills would be unmatched in their chosen territories. They might view arcane magic with deep suspicion, preferring druidic or ranger traditions. Their culture would be one of reverence for life, resilience, and stealth.


\column


<br>
<br>

Drow:
Place in Aelathar: This is where you can be creative! Given the Veilshatter Cataclysm, perhaps some Drow fled the surface world long before, or even during the catastrophe, and established hidden enclaves within the vast, dark caverns of the Cradle Sea. They could also be drawn to the shadows of Zyndralis, operating within its underbelly, or have hidden settlements near the Black Spire, studying its dark energies. Followers of Azryth would fit well.

Cultural Adaptations: If in the Cradle Sea, they might have adapted to aquatic environments or worship deities like Lyria (for her mysteries) or Azryth (for secrets and shadows). In Zyndralis, they might be information brokers, assassins, or cultists delving into forbidden aspects of the Veil, perhaps even trying to harness Veilstorms. Their traditional societal structures might be warped by Aelathar's unique pressures and deities.

Dwarves:

Place in Aelathar:
Orrthar (Ashen Peaks): This is their heartland. The volcanic environment, rich mineral veins, and geothermal energy are perfect for their skills. They would be master smiths, engineers, and miners, forming the backbone of the Pyric Assembly and the city's defenses. Many would be devout followers of Kaelgrin (for the earth and stone) and Orren (for craft), with some drawn to Theramach's fire and passion in their forges.
Korrath (Foothills of Ashen Peaks/Salt Wastes): Their resilience, love of order, and skill in stonework make them vital to Korrath. They would contribute to its fortifications, arm its soldiers, and mine the bordering mountains, following Saevyr for his law and Kaelgrin for his endurance.
Cultural Adaptations: Aelatharian dwarves would be even more stoic and pragmatic than usual. Clan loyalty would be paramount for survival. Their craft would focus on durability and function over excessive ornamentation. They'd have deep-seated rituals tied to the stability of the earth (Kaelgrin) and the art of the forge (Orren/Theramach). They might be particularly wary of arcane magic due to its destabilizing effect on the world.

Halflings:

Place in Aelathar:
Iravar & Verdant Havens: Their love of community, resilience, and ability to find joy would make them a vital part of any community dedicated to Eryssia, helping cultivate reclaimed lands or hidden oases.
Caravan Routes & Settlements: Their knack for going unnoticed or fitting in could make them successful traders, guides, or operators of inns/stables in the few relatively safe spots along trade routes or within the more diverse districts of cities like Korrath or even Zyndralis (perhaps as resourceful quartermasters or discreet information gatherers).

Cultural Adaptations: Aelatharian halflings would be masters of making the most of scarce resources. Their communities would be tight-knit, emphasizing cooperation and quiet cheerfulness as a bulwark against despair. Storytelling and simple crafts would be highly valued. They might develop unique survival techniques for desert travel if found in nomadic groups. Eryssia would be a common patron, but those focused on trade or secrets might favor Azryth.

Dragonborn:

*Heirs of a Shattered Sky*

{{quote
We are born of the sky, yet walk a broken land. 
Our scales reflect a glory that was, and a debt that is.
{{attribution Common Dragonborn saying}}
}}


The Celestial Legacy & Voryx's Shadow:

Dragonborn in Aelathar are acutely, often painfully, aware of their direct lineage from the Celestial Dragons who fought and ultimately contributed to the Veilshatter Cataclysm. The actions of Voryx, the Shattered Wyrm, hang heavy over them. This creates a fundamental schism within Dragonborn culture:

The Voryxian Atoners:
These Dragonborn believe Voryx's actions, however devastating, were a necessary, albeit tragic, sacrifice to prevent a worse fate (perhaps total annihilation by the unchecked Heart of Creation or the Elemental Titans). They often dedicate themselves to Voryx's tenets of knowledge, order, and understanding the Veil, hoping to find a way to mend what was broken or, at least, prevent further disaster. Many become Shardbound scholars, Veilwardens, or contemplative monks, often residing near Zyndralis or seeking out ancient draconic lore. They might bear their draconic heritage with a sense of solemn duty and quiet sorrow.

The Wyrmscorned: This faction views Voryx's act as an unforgivable betrayal, a catastrophic failure of draconic wisdom that doomed Aelathar. They reject Voryx and often the pursuit of arcane knowledge tied to the Veil. They might instead focus on martial prowess, adherence to pre-Cataclysm draconic codes of honor (if any are remembered), or seek to emulate the raw power and straightforwardness of the Titans, particularly Theramach, seeing his directness as a counter to draconic schemes. Some might even believe the Celestial Dragons should have allowed the Titans their dominion rather than risk the Veilrend.

The Unbound: A growing number of younger Dragonborn seek to forge a new identity, free from the direct shadow of the Cataclysm. They argue that the ancient war is over and that their purpose is to survive and thrive in Aelathar as it is, not as it was or should have been. They are pragmatic, often forming mercenary companies, leading trade caravans, or simply trying to build communities that look forward, not back.

\column

Physical Manifestations & Cultural Traits:

Their scales might sometimes shimmer with faint, residual celestial energy, especially when experiencing strong emotions or channeling innate magic. Some believe the vibrancy of their scales is tied to the health of their spirit or their connection to their ancestors.
Many Dragonborn clans retain fragments of draconic lore, songs, and rituals, though the true meanings are often debated or lost. The "Chronicle of Scales" (Voryx's artifact) is an object of immense interest or dread.
There's a deep-seated respect (or fear) for true dragons, should any still exist in hiding. Encounters would be monumental.
Their breath weapons are a potent reminder of their heritage, and how they use this power often signifies their philosophical leanings.

<br>

Place in Aelathar:

Zyndralis: A hub for Voryxian Atoners and those studying draconic history.
Orrthar: The Wyrmscorned and Unbound might find homes here, drawn by Theramach's power or the city's practical industriousness.
Korrath: Dragonborn valuing order and discipline, regardless of their view on Voryx, might serve Saevyr.
Nomadic Clans: Many Dragonborn, particularly Unbound or those seeking lost lore, roam the Scorched Cradle and the Ashen Peaks, their clans often distinguished by their specific ancestral dragon (if known) and their interpretation of history.

Gnomes:

Place in Aelathar:
Orrthar (Rock Gnomes): Their inventive genius would be highly prized here. They'd work alongside dwarves, focusing on intricate mechanisms, geothermal power systems, or perhaps unique alchemical solutions for survival. Followers of Orren or even Theramach (for the innovative spark).
Zyndralis (Forest Gnomes/Arcane Gnomes): Their natural curiosity and potential for illusion or subtle magic would draw them to the study of the Veil or Nyraea's secrets. Some might become reclusive scholars or clever tinkerers operating in the city's less obvious corners. Lunaria could also be a patron.
\column

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Hidden Enclaves: Gnomes might create small, cleverly hidden communities, perhaps in stable cave systems or camouflaged warrens, using their ingenuity to create self-sufficient, defensible homes.

Cultural Adaptations: Aelatharian gnomes would channel their curiosity and inventiveness towards survival and understanding their perilous world. They might be more cautious than their counterparts in other settings but would retain their spark of creativity. Their humor might be dry and geared towards the absurdities of their existence.

The Ballad of the Broken Weave

*(A Gnomish Retelling of the Veilshatter)*

The world was once a clockwork true, each cog and gear in place,

The Veil, a finely woven loom, that shimmered, full of grace.

It kept the Outer Ruckus out, the Inner Order neat,

A balance struck by careful hands, a harmony complete.

(So the oldest clickings tell, a whisper on the breeze.)

<br>

Then Titan-might began to chafe, at Dragon-thought so grand,

"Our making must be free!" they roared, across the verdant land.

The Dragons, with their scales of sky, said, "Order must hold sway,

Or else this perfect, grand design will surely fray away."

(A pressure gauge, some say, began to slowly rise.)

<br>

Old Voryx, wisest of his kind, or so the legends croon,

Devised a plan, a fearsome spell, beneath a watchful moon.

To seal the Heart, where chaos brewed, a power too immense,

But Theramach, the Everflame, took terrible offense!

(A crack in the mainspring, a tremor in the scheme.)


<br>

The War of Sundering commenced, a clashing, grim display,

Where mountains fell and rivers boiled, and skies turned ashen grey.

For centuries, the gears did grind, as titan fought the wyrm,

While mortal folk, like frightened ants, endured the endless storm.

(Fragmented blueprints show the damage spreading wide.)


<br>

At last, upon the Heart's scarred face, the final meeting set,

Voryx unleashed the Veilrend grand, a choice he'd soon regret.

A magic to unmake the bounds, to banish raw despair,

But oh, the cosmic spindle snapped! The world was torn right there!

(The Great Unraveling, a sound that shattered stars.)

<br>

The Heart of Creation burst apart, like a geode struck with spite,

And through the wound, the Outer Dark spewed forth its dreadful light.

The Veil, that once-so-perfect screen, was shredded, rent, and torn,

And Aelathar, our vibrant world, was blighted and forlorn.

(A thousand broken threads, no weaver could repair.)

<br>

Now dust and sorrow fill the air, the magic runs untrue,

A shimmer in the Shifting Sands, a sickly, baleful hue.

The Veilstorms howl their mournful songs, of what was and is lost,

And every spell, a gamble now, that counts a bitter cost.

(We measure out the risk, with instruments precise.)

<br>

So listen close, ye youngling gnomes, to tales of when it broke,

Remember how the perfect plan by grand ambition spoke.

We tinker still, with cog and spring, in this scorched, dusty land,

And watch the Veil, its tattered edge, with ever-steady hand.

(Perhaps one day a gear, a lever, might be mended. Perhaps.)

Goliaths:
*Children of Slumbering Earth and Raging Fire*
<br>
{{quote
The mountain dreams, the volcano roars. 

We are the echo of their might, the pulse of the enduring stone and the untamed flame.

{{attribution Orin Stonebeard, Goliath elder}}
}}


<br>

Titan-Blooded Kinship
Goliaths in Aelathar see themselves not merely as descendants of giants, but as direct kin to the Elemental Titans who shaped the world and whose power still resonates within it. The slumbering Kaelgrin and the memory of Theramach are not just deities but ancestral figures.

Kaelgrin's Stoneguard: Many Goliath tribes, particularly those dwelling in the higher, more stable regions of the Ashen Peaks or isolated mountain ranges, are deeply devoted to Kaelgrin. They believe their strength and resilience are gifts from the Maw of the Earth. Their culture is one of stoic endurance, communal support, and rituals that honor the slow, unyielding power of stone and mountain. They see themselves as protectors of the mountain homes and might be wary of excessive mining or exploitation of the earth by others (like in Orrthar). They are the quintessential Earthwardens. Their Giant Ancestry is often tied to Stone Giants.

Theramach's Forgestruck: Goliath tribes found closer to the volcanic hearts of the Ashen Peaks, or those who have integrated more into Orrthar, often feel a stronger kinship with Theramach the Everflame. They embrace passion, righteous fury (if their lands or kin are threatened), and the transformative power of fire. These Goliaths are often more dynamic and expressive than their Stoneguard cousins, excelling as powerful warriors, smiths who work the volcanic forges, or even fire-touched shamans. Their Giant Ancestry might be linked to Fire Giants.


The Unaligned Peaks: Some Goliath tribes may not align specifically with Kaelgrin or Theramach, but rather with the broader concept of the untamed elemental forces of the mountains, perhaps incorporating aspects of Vorath (if near storm-lashed peaks) or even minor elemental spirits. Their chosen Giant Ancestry (Storm, Frost, Hill, Cloud) would heavily influence their specific adaptations and beliefs. For example, Frost Giant descendants might inhabit the coldest, highest peaks of the Ashen range, while Storm Giant descendants might be drawn to areas with frequent electrical storms or high winds.

Cultural Markers & The Veil:

Goliath tribes often mark their skin with ritualistic scars or mineral-based paints that signify their lineage, deeds, and connection to specific elemental forces or mountain spirits.

Their traditional sports and competitions are all about strength, endurance, and adapting to their harsh environment – rock throwing, peak climbing, and surviving extreme temperatures.
They view arcane Veil magic with deep suspicion, seeing it as the force that tore the world apart and a corruption of true elemental power. They might tolerate its use by outsiders but would rarely practice it themselves, preferring primal magic (if any) tied to shamanistic traditions or their innate titan-blooded might.

The "Heart of Creation's Echo" (Theramach's artifact, if found) or "Kaelgrin's Resonant Core" 
would be relics of immense significance, capable of uniting or dividing Goliath tribes.

<br>

Place in Aelathar:

Ashen Peaks: This is their undisputed domain. Different tribes, based on their elemental kinship and chosen Titan-patron, would inhabit various sectors of the mountain range.
Orrthar: Forgestruck Goliaths would be a powerful presence here, contributing their strength to industry and defense. Tensions might exist with Kaelgrin's Stoneguard Goliaths who view Orrthar's extensive mining with concern.
Remote Mountain Ranges: Smaller, isolated Goliath tribes might exist in any significant mountain range that survived the Cataclysm, each with unique adaptations.

Orcs:

Place in Aelathar:

Fringe Territories & Raider Bands: Many orc tribes, pushed to the harshest environments like the deeper Salt Wastes or the more desolate parts of the Scorched Cradle, might have adopted a raiding culture out of necessity, preying on caravans or weaker settlements. Theramach (for his fury) or Vorath (for chaotic freedom) might be venerated.

Survivor Enclaves: Some orc communities might have carved out a brutal but stable existence in defensible badlands or canyons, valuing strength and resilience above all, perhaps with a grudging respect for Kaelgrin's endurance.
Orrthar/Korrath (Integrated): Individual orcs or smaller groups might find a place in cities like Orrthar (as powerful laborers or warriors) or Korrath (as disciplined soldiers, if they can adhere to the strict laws), especially if they demonstrate loyalty to the city's ideals and deities (Theramach, Saevyr, Kaelgrin).

Cultural Adaptations: Aelatharian orcs would be supremely adapted to hardship. Their societies would likely be tribal, with a strong emphasis on martial prowess and the ability to survive. They might have unique traditions for dealing with the corrupted magic or mutated creatures of their territories. Their relationship with the divine would be pragmatic, favoring gods who offer tangible power or reflect their fierce independence.

Tieflings:

Place in Aelathar: Their fiendish heritage in a world scarred by chaotic magic makes their existence complex.
Zyndralis: Many tieflings might be drawn here, either to study the Veil and their own arcane heritage (perhaps under Nyraea or Voryx), or to delve into the city's shadowy undercurrents, serving Azryth or seeking forbidden power.
Orrthar: Tieflings with a fiery lineage (perhaps Infernal) might find acceptance or even reverence among followers of Theramach.
Scattered & Secretive: Many tieflings might live on the fringes, in isolated communities, or pass through settlements trying to avoid undue attention. The social stigma of Veil-touched magic could easily extend to them.

Cultural Adaptations: Tiefling culture in Aelathar would be shaped by how they are perceived and how they perceive themselves in relation to the Veil and the Cataclysm. Some might embrace their fiendish heritage as a source of strength in a harsh world, others might seek to understand or purify it. Their chosen fiendish legacy (Abyssal, Chthonic, Infernal) would significantly influence their abilities and perhaps their cultural leanings or choice of patron deity (Azryth, Theramach, or perhaps even Voryx if seeking control). They would likely be adept at navigating suspicion and making their own way.

Aasimar:

Place in Aelathar: In a world so deeply scarred, aasimar would be exceptionally rare and significant.
Champions of Hope: They might be drawn to places where hope flickers, like fledgling communities around Iravar (serving Eryssia or Kaelarion), or trying to bring light and justice to the grim streets of Korrath (serving Saevyr or Kaelarion in a restorative sense).
Seekers of Purpose: Some might be found in Zyndralis, seeking to understand the divine tragedy and their own celestial heritage in the context of Voryx's sacrifice or Nyraea's protective efforts.
Isolated Individuals: Many aasimar might be solitary figures, guided by divine visions or a personal quest, perhaps wandering the wastes trying to aid others or fight specific manifestations of Veil corruption.

Cultural Adaptations: Aasimar in Aelathar would likely feel the weight of the world's suffering intensely. Their celestial heritage might manifest as a beacon of hope, a source of inner turmoil, or a driving force for justice or healing. They would be figures of awe, suspicion, or veneration. Their choice of Celestial Revelation (as per the 2024 rules – Necrotic Shroud, Radiant Soul, Radiant Consumption, or the new options) would dramatically shape their role and how they interact with the world's prevailing despair or faint hopes. Deities like Eryssia, Kaelarion, Voryx (for understanding sacrifice), or even a reformed vision of Saevyr (justice and protection) would be likely patrons.

The Stone-Scales

<br>

Origin & Backstory: The Stone-Scales are rare and often tragic figures in Aelathar, born from the improbable union of Dragonborn and Goliath lines. Such pairings are exceedingly uncommon, often stemming from:

<br>

Forgotten Alliances: Whispers exist of brief, desperate alliances during the darkest days of the War of Sundering or the early Age of Scorching, where isolated Dragonborn clans and Goliath tribes were forced to cooperate for survival. Children born of these unions were often seen as symbols of a painful past or a compromised lineage once the immediate crisis passed.
Outcasts United: More commonly, Stone-Scales are born from individuals already ousted from their own societies who find solace or necessity in each other's company.

<br>

Divine Echoes: Some rare sages might theorize that the intense, clashing energies of the Celestial Dragons and Elemental Titans during the Cataclysm left certain mortal lines more mutable, or that the very land, saturated with these opposing divine forces, can rarely influence births, leading to individuals who embody this ancient conflict.

Regardless of their specific origin, Stone-Scales are almost universally met with suspicion. Dragonborn communities often see the "titan blood" as a corruption of their celestial heritage, a reminder of their ancient enemies and the earth-bound brute force they disdained. Goliath tribes, particularly Kaelgrin's Stoneguard, may view the "dragon scales" as a mark of arrogance, unnatural ambition, or a connection to the chaotic magic that scarred the world. Forgestruck Goliaths tied to Theramach might be slightly more accepting of their inherent might, but still wary of their draconic side.

Thus, Stone-Scales are wanderers, often solitary, or found in small, tight-knit groups—"found families"—making their way through the harshest parts of Aelathar. They learn self-reliance from a young age, carrying the weight of two legacies while belonging to neither.


Physical Appearance: Stone-Scales are imposing figures, larger and more heavily built than most Dragonborn, but perhaps more lithe than a pureblood Goliath. Their skin is a mosaic of tough, leathery hide interspersed with patches of draconic scales, often muted in color (greys, browns, dusky reds, deep bronzes, or obsidian-like blacks). Their facial structure blends draconic and goliath features: a strong jawline, prominent brow, and perhaps smaller, swept-back ears or cranial crests. Some might have vestigial claws or a heavier, more powerful, but shorter, tail than a typical Dragonborn. Their overall build speaks of both draconic power and goliath resilience.

<br>


Place in Aelathar: Most Stone-Scales are nomadic, forced by circumstance and prejudice to traverse the unforgiving Scorched Cradle, the rugged foothills of the Ashen Peaks, or the desolate Salt Wastes. They might find roles as solitary guardians of remote, forgotten places, uniquely skilled guides through dangerous terrains (their combined heritage offering surprising survival insights), or even as misunderstood bounty hunters or mercenaries. Their relationship with the established deities of Aelathar, particularly Voryx (celestial dragon), Kaelgrin (earth titan), and Theramach (fire titan), is often complex; they might feel torn, rejected by all, or choose to forge a unique spiritual path that acknowledges the conflicting powers within their blood. Small, hidden enclaves of Stone-Scales might exist in the deepest wilderness, fiercely protecting their own.

Stone-Scale Traits:


Creature Type: You are a Humanoid.
Size: Medium (though typically stand 6 to well over 7 feet tall and are heavily built).
Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

<br>

Hybrid Inheritance: Your mixed lineage grants you the following benefits:
Draconic Claws: Your hands and feet are tipped with hardened claws, which are natural weapons you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
Powerful Build: You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.  


Stone's Endurance: When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.  


Resonant Roar: You can use your action to unleash a powerful, concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. The damage increases by an additional 1d6 when you reach 5th level (3d6), 11th level (4d6), and 17th level (5d6). After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.  


Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and your choice of either Draconic or Giant.

The Veilkin (Veil-Touched Humanoids)

<br>
<br>

{{quote

We are the Veil's discordant song, a tapestry of what was, what is, and what should never be. Yet, even in dissonance, a single pure note can sometimes be found.

{{attribution Uknown Origin}}
}}

}}





Origin & Backstory: 

The Veilkin are a poignant testament to the pervasive, corrupting influence of the fractured Veil on Aelathar's mortal inhabitants. They are not a race born of ancient lineage in the traditional sense, but rather individuals whose very being has been deeply and visibly touched by the raw, chaotic energies of the Veil, often from conception or very early childhood. 

They most commonly descend from Human or Elven stock, or a mix thereof, particularly from communities dwelling in areas where the Veil is thin and dangerously unstable (like the Shimmering Sands or near the ominous Black Spire) or from those unfortunate enough to be frequently ravaged by Veilstorms.

 While many who suffer extreme Veil exposure become mindless Veilshard monstrosities or succumb to madness and severe, debilitating mutations, the Veilkin represent a strange, precarious equilibrium. The "wrongs" in their forms—the physical manifestations of chaotic magic—are manifold and varied, but for some, these alterations stabilize, leaving them sentient and self-aware, albeit forever marked as different.

 Society at large in Aelathar often views Veilkin with a mixture of fear, pity, and intense suspicion. They are living reminders of magic's corrupting touch and the ever-present danger of the Veil itself. 

 Many are ostracized, feared as harbingers of Veilstorms or bad luck, or even hunted by zealous Veilwardens who see them as ticking time bombs or conduits for further corruption. Yet, the "glimmer of hope" for the Veilkin lies in their unique, inherent resilience and, for a select few, an intuitive, almost symbiotic connection to the Veil that others lack. 

These individuals learn to navigate their afflictions, sometimes even finding strange strengths or subtle advantages within their altered states, striving to live meaningful lives despite the pervasive prejudice and the inherent dangers tethered to their very existence.

\column




Physical Appearance: Veilkin often possess the slender build that hints at elven ancestry mixed with the varied features of humans, but this underlying form is overlaid with numerous unpredictable, asymmetrical, and often unsettling manifestations of Veil energy. No two Veilkin are exactly alike in their specific markings:


Skin: It may shimmer with faint, unnatural, shifting colors (like oily rainbows, bruised twilight hues, or the sickly greens and purples sometimes seen in Veilstorms , exhibit patches of smooth, flawed crystal-like growths (similar to early Crystallization effects but stable from birth), or have intricate, mobile patterns resembling static, heat haze, or flowing arcane glyphs.

Eyes: Could be solid orbs of unsettling color (vibrant violet, dull silver, unnerving emerald green), multifaceted like an insect's, emit a faint, otherworldly glow, or have irises that slowly swirl with an inner light, sometimes reflecting patterns not truly present.

Hair: Might be an unnatural, vibrant color (blues, pinks, stark whites unrelated to age), possess a distinctly crystalline or metallic texture, or even seem to float or drift slightly as if underwater or in a low-gravity environment, subtly defying normal physics.

Other Features: Elongated or subtly pointed ears are common, hinting at their elven/humanoid base. They might possess an extra, non-functional (or eerily graceful) digit on one hand, slightly asymmetrical facial features that are just a little "off," or an almost imperceptible aura that causes a faint buzzing sound, a feeling of static electricity, or a subtle, unplaceable scent (like ozone or strange blossoms [Source: Page 3]) in those who stand very close. These features are generally not debilitating but clearly and permanently mark them as "other."

Veilkin Traits:


<br>


Creature Type: You are a Humanoid.

Size: Medium.

Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Accustomed to the strange light of the Veil or the shadows where you often dwell, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.  

Preternatural Awareness: You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on noticing subtle magical disturbances or shifts in the environment related to the Veil (such as the precursor signs of a Veilstorm or areas of thin Veil).

Veil's Imprint: The Veil's chaotic touch has left an indelible mark upon you. Choose one of the following benefits, representing your unique adaptation or "glimmer of hope":
Shimmering Veil: As a reaction when you are hit by an attack roll, you can cause your form to briefly shimmer and distort with Veil energy. This imposes disadvantage on the triggering attack roll. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Chaotic Spark: You know one cantrip of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip is Charisma. Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.
Warped Mind: The chaotic nature of your being makes your thoughts difficult to grasp. You have resistance to psychic damage.
Unsettling Grace: Your unique, Veil-touched appearance and mannerisms can be both captivating and disconcerting. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation.


Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.

<br>

<br>

<br>

Place in Aelathar: Veilkin are most often found in the shadowed alleys or restricted arcane quarters of Zyndralis (where they might be subjects of intense study, objects of fear, or hidden by those sympathetic to their plight), or as isolated individuals or small, secretive groups near areas of high Veil activity like the Shimmering Sands (if they can develop the means to survive its other harshness). Some may attempt to live anonymously within larger, more cosmopolitan settlements, constantly wary of discovery. 

They might be drawn to the worship of Nyraea the Veilweaver, hoping she can offer understanding, guidance, or protection from the Veil's more malevolent aspects. Others might find a place among the followers of Azryth, Keeper of Shadows, using their unique nature to navigate the world of secrets. 

Those Veilkin who manage to harness their "glimmer of hope" often become cautious explorers of Veil phenomena, unique artists whose creations reflect the unsettling beauty and inherent horror of their existence, or even quiet advocates for others like them, seeking understanding in a world that largely fears what they represent.

Magic in Aelathar – A Corrupted Gift
Magic in Aelathar is the lifeblood of its desperate survivors and the echo of its catastrophic past. It is a force that can mend a wound, coax a flicker of light in the oppressive darkness, or raise a barrier against the horrors of the wastes. Yet, every shimmer of power, every incantation whispered on the dust-choked wind, carries with it the indelible taint of the Veilshatter Cataclysm. The Veil, the very fabric separating realities, was not merely torn but fundamentally corrupted, and all magic that flows through or from it bears this scar. To wield magic in the Scorched Cradle is to dance on a razor's edge, balancing need against peril, power against an insidious, creeping decay.

This perilous nature has profoundly shaped the landscape of spellcasting in Aelathar. True arcane practitioners—those who seek to master the raw stuff of magic, bending the fundamental energies of the cosmos to their will, such as Wizards with their intricate formulae and Sorcerers with their innate, volatile power—are a rare and often wary breed. 

To draw directly from the chaotic, unstable Veil is to invite its corruption. Each potent spell cast by these dedicated arcane scholars and conduits risks not only immediate, violent backlash but also a slow, creeping transformation known as Crystallization, a physical manifestation of the Veil's chaotic essence taking root in mortal flesh. Consequently, the great academies of magic are few, their traditions steeped in caution as much as knowledge, and their numbers are a fraction of what they might be in healthier worlds.

\column

Curiously, an enduring enigma for Aelathar's scholars of the arcane is why this direct backlash seems primarily to afflict those who delve deepest into the fundamental manipulation of raw magical energies. 

Other traditions that touch upon the arcane weave—the subtle enchantments of a Bard's song, the nature-infused spells of a Ranger, or the combat-laced cantrips of an Eldritch Knight or Arcane Trickster—appear to largely bypass these dire consequences. 

Lore passed down through generations, and debated heatedly in Zyndralis, posits several theories: perhaps their magic is more 'pattern-based,' drawing upon established, less volatile currents rather than the raw, churning chaos of the deep Veil. Others suggest the volume and intensity of power directly channeled by Wizards and Sorcerers is what attracts the Veil’s corrupting gaze, like a bright flame drawing moths. 

Whatever the truth, these other practitioners find their arcane talents functioning with a degree of stability that dedicated mages can only envy, though even they are not entirely immune to the ambient dangers of a Veilstorm or a severely thinned Veil.

Given these dangers, it is no surprise that divine magic is the most prevalent and trusted form of spellcasting across the Scorched Cradle. Those who draw their power from the deities of Aelathar—be they the stern Justicars of Saevyr, the life-tending Verdant Hands of Eryssia, or the knowledge-seeking Shardbound of Voryx—find their magic filtered and mediated. The gods, in their wisdom, sorrow, or perhaps even their own diminished capacity, act as intermediaries, buffering their faithful from the worst of the Veil’s raw, untamed power. While the prayers of a cleric or the oath of a paladin can still falter in places where divine influence wanes or the Veil screams too loudly, they do not carry the same insidious personal cost as the direct manipulation of arcane forces.

Druidic traditions, practitioners of the primal magic of the natural world, are a dwindling light in Aelathar. The widespread desolation of the land offers little for their ancient rites to take root in. They are figures of resilience and deep sorrow, clinging to the few pockets of Aelathar where life, however twisted or tenacious, still endures. The Verdant Heart of Iravar in the Veiljungles, hidden oases nurtured by Eryssia's grace, or remote, untouched canyons in the Ashen Peaks are their sanctuaries. Here, they strive to understand the corrupted patterns of Aelathar's nature, to heal what little they can, and to act as staunch guardians against further despoilment. Their numbers are few, their task immense, and their magic a poignant reminder of all that was lost.

Yet, amidst the pervasive dread and the daily struggle, faint whispers of change regarding the Veil itself have begun to circulate among those who study its patterns. Historical records meticulously kept in Zyndralis, and the oral traditions passed down by desert nomads who have weathered generations of its fury, suggest a subtle shift. Over the last few centuries, it is believed by many that the terrifying Veilstorms—those localized tears in reality that unleash raw chaos—have been gradually, almost imperceptibly, lessening in both their raw destructive strength and their overall frequency.

This observation is a source of both fervent hope and deep unease. Some scholars and mystics theorize that this indicates a slow, natural mending of the Veil, a sign that Aelathar itself is attempting to heal its deepest wound. Others fear this is merely a lull in a far grander, more terrifying cycle, a cosmic breath drawn before an even greater unraveling. And still others whisper that the subtle interventions of deities like Nyraea, the Veilweaver, are responsible, her silent, unseen efforts patching the most grievous tears. The truth remains elusive, another of Aelathar’s many grim mysteries, but the debate itself shapes the anxieties and ambitions of those who live under its scarred sky.

This chapter will delve into the specifics of how these different forms of magic function in Aelathar, the unique perils faced by arcane casters, the boons granted by the divine, the resilience of druidic practices, and the ever-present influence of the fractured, sorrowful Veil. For to understand magic in Aelathar is to understand the very soul of the Scorched Cradle.

Arcane Magic: The Double-Edged Sword

Arcane magic users in Aelathar tap directly into the volatile energies of the Veil. This grants them access to incredible power but also exposes them to the raw, twisting nature of that chaotic energy.

Effects of Magic on Casters (Detailed Mechanics for D&D 5e)
    Using magic in Aelathar comes with inherent risks due to the corrupted nature of the Veil. Each time a caster taps into the Veil, they risk destabilizing their body and mind.

Veilcasting and Its Risks:
Veil Corruption Table: When a caster expends spell slots under specific conditions, they must contend with the Veil Corruption table. The more power drawn, the greater the risk.
Triggers for Destabilization Roll:
Casting an arcane spell of 3rd level or higher.
Overcasting: Casting a spell when all appropriate spell slots are depleted by converting Hit Points into temporary spell slots.
Casting multiple (3 or more) leveled arcane spells in rapid succession (e.g., within 1 minute) without a short rest.
Aetheric Amplification: Voluntarily attempting to increase a spell's level or power beyond their normal capabilities (DM discretion for how this is attempted and its specific DC).

Veilstorms


A direct and terrifying manifestation of the Veil's instability are Veilstorms. These are not mere weather phenomena but localized tears or agitations in the fabric of reality itself.


Appearance and Sensation: A Veilstorm often appears on the horizon as a colossal, roiling wall of shimmering, multi-hued particles, resembling a massive sandstorm but composed of raw magical energy rather than mundane dust. The air within crackles with tangible static, strange lights flicker and dance, and faint, distorted whispers seem to echo from no discernible source. Visibility is heavily obscured by the swirling energies. While not directly causing physical damage like a mundane storm (no bludgeoning from wind or debris), the disorienting sensory input can cause intense unease, nausea, and mild paranoia in those unaccustomed to such raw exposure to the Veil.
Size and Movement: Veilstorms are typically vast, capable of covering many square miles. They tend to move slowly and somewhat unpredictably across the landscape, sometimes lingering over an area for days before dissipating or moving on. They are more common in regions where the Veil is inherently thin, such as the Shimmering Sands or near potent magical landmarks like the Black Spire, but can theoretically manifest anywhere, especially after a large discharge of arcane energy.
Impact on Arcane Magic: Casting arcane magic within a Veilstorm is exceptionally dangerous due to the highly agitated and corrupted state of the Veil. The usual risks are significantly amplified:
Any Constitution saving throw against Veil Corruption (see Section IV.B.1) made while within a Veilstorm is made with disadvantage.
If this saving throw is failed, the caster must roll twice on the Veil Corruption Table and suffers both effects. If the same effect is rolled twice, its severity is intensified (e.g., damage or duration doubled, or a more potent version of the effect occurs, at the DM's discretion).
Any Crystallization Points gained from a Veil Corruption effect while inside a Veilstorm are doubled.
Lore and Scholarly Observation: In the early centuries after the Veilshatter Cataclysm, Veilstorms were far more frequent, violent, and widespread, contributing significantly to the reshaping of Aelathar and the fall of fledgling survivor settlements. Scholars in Zyndralis and other centers of learning, particularly those dedicated to Voryx or Nyraea, have meticulously chronicled Veilstorm activity for generations. A growing consensus among these scholars suggests that Veilstorms, while still a grave threat, have been gradually becoming both fewer in number and slightly less intense in their raw chaotic output over the last few centuries. Some theorize this indicates a slow, natural mending of the Veil, while others fear it's a lull before an even greater unraveling, or perhaps the result of Nyraea's subtle interventions. This perceived decline is a subject of intense debate and varying interpretations, influencing political decisions, trade routes, and the anxieties of those living in storm-prone regions.

Veil Corruption

Veil Corruption Roll:
        Each time a trigger condition is met, the caster rolls a Constitution saving throw against Veil Corruption. The DC is 10 + the spell’s original level (or the effective level if amplified). On a failure, roll 1d20 on the Veil Corruption Table:

        | d20 Roll | Corruption Effect                                                                                                                                                              |
        | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | 1-4      | Minor Veil Wound: You take force damage equal to twice the spell level and suffer disadvantage on ability checks using your spellcasting ability for 1 minute.                  |
        | 5-8      | Veil Fatigue: You gain 1 level of exhaustion.                                                                                                                                |
        | 9-12     | Veil Sickness: You are poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, you find it difficult to focus, and the casting time of any spell you cast is doubled.                |
        | 13-16    | Veilburn: The spell goes off, but a surge of corrupted energy deals force damage to you and all creatures within 10 feet of you equal to the spell's level + your proficiency bonus. |
        | 17-19    | Veil Fracture: You lose access to one spell slot of the same level as the triggering spell (or the highest level available if that slot is gone) for the next 24 hours. The lost energy manifests as harmless but unsettling lights flickering around you. |
        | 20       | Veilshard Transformation (Partial): Your body begins to visibly crystallize in patches. Gain vulnerability to radiant and psychic damage for 1d4 days. After this period, you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, one of the Long-Term Effects of Magic Use (Crystallization Trait) manifests permanently, and you gain 1 Crystallization Point. On a success, the vulnerability fades, but you still gain 1 Crystallization Point. |

<br>

Overcasting: Sacrificing Health for Magic:

When a caster is out of spell slots of a particular level, they may choose to Overcast, converting their life force into magical energy.
The caster can expend Hit Points to create a single temporary spell slot of a level they can normally cast. The cost is 5 Hit Points per spell level of the temporary slot created. This damage cannot be reduced or avoided.
After casting a spell using such a temporary slot, they must immediately roll on the Veil Corruption Table, and this roll is made with disadvantage.
Temporary spell slots created this way last for 1 minute or until used. Only one such temporary slot can be maintained at a time.

\column

Long-Term Effects of Magic Use (Crystallization):
   Repeated exposure to Veil Corruption and the stresses of channeling its power has lingering, permanent effects on a caster.

Threshold of Crystallization: Each time a caster suffers a "Veilshard Transformation (Partial)" effect (a roll of 20 on the Veil Corruption Table), or at the DM's discretion for other severe magical traumas, they gain one Crystallization Point. When a caster accrues 3 Crystallization Points, they permanently gain one of the following traits (DM’s choice or random roll, aim for thematic relevance):
Veilshard Eyes: Your eyes become multifaceted like insectoid lenses or solid orbs of shifting crystal. Gain darkvision 60 ft. (or +30 ft. if already possessed) but suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against creatures that can see your eyes. 
Crystalline Skin: Patches of your skin become hard, smooth, and strangely translucent, like flawed crystal. Gain resistance to piercing damage from non-magical attacks but gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
Shattered Mind: Your thought patterns become erratic and alien. Gain advantage on saving throws against charm and frightened effects but suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, as distracting whispers fill your mind.
Aetheric Resonance: One of your limbs (arm or leg) becomes partially crystalline, crackling with faint energy. You learn one cantrip from any spell list (it counts as an arcane spell for you), but you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

<br>

Casters with 5 Crystallization Points are on the brink. They must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw each long rest. On a failure, they become a true Veilshard NPC, losing their free will and becoming a crystalline monstrosity driven by raw magical instinct (under DM control). Even on a success, they might experience unsettling visions or urges. Few reach this stage and retain their sanity or control.

A Glimmer of Hope - Reversing Crystallization:
While true reversal is exceedingly rare and difficult, some hope remains. The potent magic of a *Greater Restoration* spell, if cast upon an individual suffering from Crystallization, can scour away the encroaching Veil-taint, removing 1 Crystallization Point.

However, the Veil's chaotic energy, which infuses the crystalline structures within the afflicted, actively resists such purification. This act of cleansing agitates the remaining Veil-infused crystal, causing it to temporarily "harden" or become "defensive" against further magical intervention. It is as if the trapped essence of the Veil itself recoils and reinforces its hold on the mortal form. Consequently, Greater Restoration can only be successfully used to remove a Crystallization Point from the same individual once per week. After this period, the Veil's heightened resistance subsides, allowing another attempt. This makes any significant reversal a slow, arduous, and resource-intensive process, often requiring the dedication of powerful healers and the will of the afflicted to endure. The knowledge of this limited cure is not widespread, often held by reclusive healers of Eryssia or learned scholars of Voryx.

<br>

Druidic and Clerical Magic: 
Unlike arcane magic, druidic magic (drawing from the resilient, albeit twisted, natural world of Aelathar) and clerical magic (granted by the divine powers, who act as intermediaries or filters against the raw chaos of the Veil) are generally considered more stable. They do not directly strain the Veil in the same dangerous manner, as their power sources are more grounded in the world's battered nature or are divinely mediated. However, in areas of extreme Veil thinning or during Veilstorms, even these magic forms can sometimes have unpredictable side effects.

<br>

\column

Pros and Cons of Arcane Magic:
Pros:
Unmatched Power: Magic drawn from the Veil is potent, capable of reshaping landscapes (if rarely), summoning powerful elemental effects, or manipulating reality in significant ways.
Unique Abilities & Spells: Veil magic can grant access to unique spells and abilities, such as summoning Veilshards (crystallized chaotic energy), harnessing the power of Veilstorms, or creating weapons of pure chaotic force (DM discretion for new spell creation).
Caster Prestige & Fear: Despite the dangers, skilled magic users are often revered for their power and feared for their potential, granting them a unique, if precarious, social standing in Aelathari society. Some see them as saviors, others as ticking time bombs.
Desperate Measures: Overcasting and Aetheric Amplification allow for acts of incredible power in dire moments, though the cost is severe.
Crystallization Traits: While a sign of corruption, some long-term effects can provide situational benefits.
Cons:
Veil Corruption: The constant risk of physical or mental destabilization adds significant tension and cost to spellcasting.
Social Stigma & Hostility: Obvious Veil-Touched effects or Crystallization Traits can lead to social stigmatization, fear, and can attract unwanted, often hostile, attention from common folk, authorities, or Veilwardens.
Localized Veilstorms: Overuse or particularly potent displays of arcane magic risk tearing localized rifts in the Veil, creating chaotic magical phenomena known as Veilstorms that can devastate the surrounding area.
Veilwardens: These enforcers (see Factions) actively hunt or monitor casters deemed reckless or a threat to the Veil's stability.
Crystallization: The long-term accumulation of Crystallization Points means no caster can escape the cost of magic forever. Becoming a mindless Veilshard is an ever-present danger.

\page

Veilshard Extraction:
SpellCasters can attempt to harvest Veilshards—crystallized fragments of raw chaotic energy—from areas where the Veil is thin (like the Shimmering Sands) or recently agitated by powerful magic or Veilstorms. 

This process is dangerous:
It requires 1 hour of concentration and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The person attempting must be proficient and have either Smith or Jewelcrafting tools available
On success, the harvester takes 1d8 psychic damage (cannot be reduced) and obtains a Veilshard.
On failure, the harvester takes 2d8 psychic damage and a Veilstorm may be triggered (DM discretion).
A Veilshard can be crushed as a bonus action to regain one expended 1st-level spell slot, or as an action to regain one 2nd-level spell slot. Using more than one Veilshard per long rest inflicts one level of exhaustion per additional shard. They are also prized as components for unique magic items or rituals.

These deities often have unique festivals, such as the "Night of Whispers" for Azryth where secrets are shared in confidence, or the "Day of Embers" for Theramach involving grand displays of fire and artistry. Their holy sites might range from grand temples in cities to hidden groves, submerged caves, or lonely mountain shrines.

The World of Aelathar
Geography
Aelathar is a vast, disc-shaped continent, a scarred and battered platter adrift in an often-tempestuous Outer Sea. Its very structure seems to echo the concentric shockwaves of the Veilshatter Cataclysm that defined its bleak destiny. From its turbulent outer waters to the terrifying epicenter of its devastation, Aelathar is a world of distinct, layered rings, each presenting unique challenges and horrors to those who dare to call it home or foolishly seek to traverse it.
The Outer Sea (The Endless Churn)
Encircling the entire disc of Aelathar is the Outer Sea, a vast and treacherous expanse of dark, turbulent waters.
Nature: Rarely calm, the sea is plagued by violent storms, rogue waves of immense size, and unnaturally strong currents that seem to pull ships towards unseen dooms or dash them against the jagged, unwelcoming coasts of the Salt Wastes. The water itself is often frigid, tasting bitterly of brine and something older, more unsettling – perhaps the dissolved sorrow of the world.
Mysteries & Dangers: Legends speak of colossal, unseen leviathans that dwell in its lightless depths, creatures that predate the Cataclysm or were born from its primal oceanic upheavals. Ghostly lights are sometimes seen dancing on the waves far from shore, luring sailors to their doom, and unnatural fogs can descend without warning, disorienting even the most experienced navigators. Few dare to sail far from Aelathar’s shores, and even fewer return. The Cradle Sea, a vast subterranean ocean, is rumored to have hidden, perilous connections to this Outer Sea in the deepest underwater trenches.

The Salt Wastes (The Desiccated Ring)
The first terrestrial ring forming the "crust" of Aelathar is the immense and arid Salt Wastes.
Nature: Stretching for countless leagues, these seemingly endless salt flats glitter cruelly under the harsh sun, a white, cracked expanse that offers little life and even less hope. The silence here is profound, broken only by the crunch of salt underfoot and the mournful whistling of the wind that carries fine, stinging salt particles. What little water can be found is often hypersaline or tainted.
Magical Infusion & Perils: A direct consequence of the Veilshatter Cataclysm, the Salt Wastes were formed as rivers boiled away and fertile soil turned to dust, leaving behind vast salt deposits deeply infused with residual, chaotic magical energy. These salts sometimes shimmer with faint, sickly colors (greens, purples, bruised twilight hues). Prolonged exposure is not only inhospitable but actively dangerous, leading to severe dehydration, madness, salt-encrusted mutations, and encounters with salt-cryst creatures like the Salt-Cryst Stalker. Mirages are common, often imbued with Veil energy, whispering lies or showing tantalizing glimpses of impossible oases.
Inhabitants: Only the hardiest Human or Orcish nomadic tribes traverse its deeper sections, possessing secret ways to find brackish water or navigate by subtle salt patterns. Mining colonies, primarily of Dwarves and Humans, cling to the more stable inner edges of this ring, where it borders the Inhabitable Lands, seeking rare minerals amidst the desolation. Korrath, the Iron Bastion, is situated in the defensible foothills where the Salt Wastes begin to transition.

Factions & Organizations

The Veilwardens: An order with varying regional doctrines. In Zyndralis, they are researchers and regulators. In Korrath, they are zealous hunters of unsanctioned mages. Elsewhere, they might be solitary mystics seeking to heal the Veil. Their common thread is a deep concern with arcane magic's impact. Goal: Protect Aelathar from magical catastrophe, either by control, eradication, or understanding of arcane magic.
The Shardbound (Voryx Clergy): Protectors of knowledge, students of the Veil. Goal: Gather and preserve lore, understand the Veil, and find a way to stabilize or heal the world, often believing in difficult sacrifices for the greater good.
The Weavekeepers (Nyraea Clergy): Guardians of ley lines, promoters of responsible magic, seers. Goal: Maintain the balance of magic and fate, protect the innocent from magical harm, and subtly guide events towards a less chaotic future.
The Earthwardens (Kaelgrin Clergy): Stoic protectors of the land, miners, and enduring communities. Goal: Live in accordance with the earth's slow rhythms, endure hardship with resilience, and protect the land from those who would exploit it wantonly.
The Verdant Hands (Eryssia Clergy): Healers, protectors of nature, rebels against despoilers. Goal: Nurture life, heal the sick and the land, protect wild places, and foster hope and community.
Children of the Everflame (Theramach Cults): Zealous revolutionaries, passionate artisans, or destructive nihilists. Goal: Varies wildly from forging new societies through fiery revolution to simply reveling in destruction and raw power.
Trade Guilds & Caravan Alliances: Such as the "Saltcutters' Compact" or the "Ashen Peak Prospectors." These groups are vital for the flow of scarce resources between settlements. Goal: Profit and survival through trade, often braving immense dangers and navigating complex political landscapes.
Survivor Enclaves & Raider Bands: Numerous small, isolated communities barely eking out an existence, and desperate bands of raiders who prey on the weak or on caravans. Goal: Immediate survival, by any means necessary.

Voryx's Regret (The Shard of the Veilrend)

Description: This artifact is not a single object but a collection of three to seven crystalline "tears," each the size of a human fist, that shimmer with an internal, chaotic light of bruised purples, sickly greens, and stark whites. They orbit a central point of focus determined by the attuned wielder (it could be a person, a staff, or a sacred site). The tears emit a faint, sorrowful, and almost inaudible hum, and feel unnaturally cold, drawing warmth from their surroundings. Looking into them reveals fleeting, nightmarish glimpses of the moment the Veil was torn.

Powers (Attunement Required, likely by a powerful spellcaster or one with a deep connection to Voryx's ideals):
Veil Sight: The wielder gains Truesight out to 60 feet regarding the Veil, able to see its currents, weaknesses, nascent rifts, and concentrations of magical energy as if they were tangible.

Sacrificial Ward: As a reaction, the wielder can draw one of the tears closer, causing it to absorb a spell targeting them or an ally within 30 feet. The tear shatters, nullifying the spell, but the wielder suffers 2 levels of exhaustion and takes 1d10 psychic damage per level of the absorbed spell. A shattered tear reforms after 1d4 weeks.

Whispers of the Wyrm: The wielder is constantly assailed by fragmented prophecies, strategic insights, and the dying laments of Voryx. This grants advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) and Wisdom (Insight) checks related to ancient history, the Veil, or cosmic entities, but disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks as they become increasingly detached and speak in unsettling, cryptic ways.
Echo of the Veilrend (Use with Extreme Caution): Once, and only once, the wielder can attempt to channel the artifact's full power. They choose a point within 1 mile. A cataclysmic wave of unmaking energy erupts in a 300-foot radius sphere from that point. All structures are obliterated. Creatures take 20d10 force damage and 20d10 psychic damage (DC 25 Constitution save for half). The Veil in that area is permanently scarred, becoming a maelstrom of chaotic magic (a massive, permanent Veilstorm). The wielder must make a DC 30 Constitution saving throw. On a success, they are reduced to 0 hit points and gain 5 levels of Crystallization Points (from your magic system). On a failure, they are utterly annihilated, their essence scattered into the Veil, and Voryx's Regret vanishes, only to reappear elsewhere in Aelathar decades or centuries later.

\column

Lore: Voryx's Regret is believed to be the crystallized sorrow, magical backlash, and shattered moral certainty of Voryx himself, formed in the instant he unleashed the Veilrend. The "tears" are said to be solidified moments of that reality-tearing spell, forever echoing his desperate sacrifice and its devastating consequences. Legends claim the artifact seeks out individuals with the potential for immense understanding or a willingness to make ultimate sacrifices, guiding or damning them. The Shardbound covet it, seeing it as Voryx's final message, while others fear it as a catalyst for further doom.

<br>

Drawbacks: Beyond the power-specific costs, attunement slowly erodes the wielder's emotional connections, making them cold, calculating, and obsessed with a grand, often tragic, cosmic balance. They may cease to sleep, haunted by Voryx's visions. Attracts powerful entities from beyond the Veil drawn to its unique resonance.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page

The Unfettered Heart of Theramach

Description: A pulsating, igneous rock, roughly the size of a human torso, that shifts between states of molten lava, razor-sharp obsidian, superheated steam, and crackling lightning. It is never truly solid nor fully dispersed. It radiates intense heat and a palpable aura of raw, unbridled elemental fury and creation. It emits a deep, rhythmic thrum, like the怒 FURY of a caged god.

Powers (Attunement requires surviving direct, prolonged exposure to its raw elemental power, and perhaps a ritual of branding by its energies):
Elemental Supremacy: The wielder chooses one element (fire, earth, air, or water) upon attunement. They gain immunity to that element and can control it with unparalleled might (e.g., shaping vast walls of fire, causing targeted earthquakes, summoning hurricanes, creating tidal waves). They gain powerful, but less refined, control over the other three base elements.

Titan's Form: Once per long rest, the wielder can transform into a lesser elemental avatar of their chosen element for 1 hour, gaining immense size, strength, and elemental abilities.
Primordial Font: The artifact can "bleed" raw elemental energy into its surroundings. This can be used to create temporary elemental servants, infuse weapons with elemental power, or (uncontrolled) cause chaotic elemental phenomena like spontaneous combustion, petrification, or flash floods in an area.
Heart of Creation's Echo: Once per month, the wielder can draw upon the artifact to cast any single evocation or transmutation spell of 8th level or lower as if it were on their spell list, without needing material components. The spell manifests with extreme elemental ferocity.

\column

Lore: This is one ofthe largest, most potent fragments of the Heart of Creation, the primordial wellspring of elemental power shattered during the Veilshatter Cataclysm. This piece is believed to have absorbed a significant portion of Theramach the Everflame's untamed spirit and fury during his final battle. It was hurled into the earth, its impact site becoming the volatile Ashen Peaks, where it smoldered for centuries, its chaotic energy constantly reshaping the mountains. Followers of Theramach, particularly the most zealous fire mages and revolutionaries in Orrthar, seek it to fully unleash their god's destructive and creative potential upon Aelathar. Worshippers of Kaelgrin or Eryssia might see it as a dangerous imbalance that must be contained or neutralized.

<br>

Drawbacks: The wielder's personality becomes increasingly volatile, impulsive, and prone to fits of rage or exuberant creation, mirroring Theramach's nature. Their physical form slowly takes on characteristics of their chosen element (e.g., fiery eyes, stony skin). The artifact constantly leaks elemental energy, making stealth impossible and often causing unintended collateral damage. It attracts powerful elemental creatures who may seek to serve, destroy, or claim the Heart-Fragment.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

The Scales of Sylvandros (The Last Celestial's Mandate)

Description: A magnificent breastplate and matching helm forged from interlocking, luminous scales that shift through all the hues of a healthy, pre-Cataclysm sky: dawn gold, midday azure, twilight rose, and midnight indigo. The scales feel impossibly light yet harder than any known metal. They radiate a profound aura of ancient peace, unyielding order, and deep, cosmic sorrow. Faint, harmonious chimes can be heard when the armor is worn, and looking upon it can bring visions of Aelathar's verdant past.

Powers (Attunement requires an act of supreme selflessness and a commitment to restoring true order and life, judged by the artifact itself):

Celestial Aegis: Grants a base AC of 20 (cannot be combined with other armor bonuses) and advantage on all saving throws against spells and magical effects. The wearer is immune to fear and charm effects.

Voice of Command: The wielder can speak with perfect authority, and their voice can be heard clearly over any distance up to a mile. They gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks when dealing with creatures susceptible to lawful authority or draconic presence.
Breath of Primordial Law (Recharges at Dawn): The wielder can unleash a 60-foot cone of pure, ordering energy. Creatures of chaotic alignment in the area must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. Extraplanar chaotic creatures are banished to their home plane. This breath can also mend broken objects, purify corrupted land in a small radius, or temporarily stabilize a minor Veil disturbance.

Dragon's True Sight: The wearer gains Truesight out to 120 feet and can perceive the true nature and alignment of any creature they look upon.

\column

Lore: The Scales of Sylvandros are said to be the shed battle regalia of Sylvandros, the eldest and wisest of the Celestial Dragons, who fought alongside Voryx but vehemently opposed the Veilrend. Witnessing the Cataclysm, Sylvandros wept for the world and, before retreating to an unknown plane or state of hibernation, left this armor as a symbol of hope and a mandate for a future champion to restore what was lost. It was hidden within the heart of a petrified ancient tree in the deepest, most inaccessible part of the Veiljungles, guarded by ancient spirits of nature. Finding it is a monumental quest. It represents the lost order and the potential for true, uncorrupted restoration.

<br>

Drawbacks: The wielder is bound by an unyielding code of justice and order, becoming incapable of deceit or acting against their conscience. They are burdened by the immense weight of Sylvandros's sorrow and the responsibility to heal the world. The artifact actively resists any wielder who strays from a path of righteousness or seeks personal power. It is a beacon to both those who would aid its cause and ancient enemies of the Celestial Dragons.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

Kaelgrin's Resonant Core

Description: A massive, uncut geode, at least six feet in diameter, with a rough, unassuming stone exterior. If successfully and carefully cracked open (requiring immense strength or precise earth-shaping magic), its interior is revealed to be lined with colossal, amber-like crystals that pulse with a slow, deep, golden light. The air around it hums with powerful telluric energy, and small stones and pebbles levitate gently. Touching the crystals floods the mind with the slow, ponderous thoughts and dreams of the slumbering earth.

Powers (Attunement requires a deep, meditative communion with the Core, often lasting days, and an acceptance of the earth's slow, enduring nature):
Earth-Speech: The attuned wielder can communicate with stone and earth elementals as if by telepathy and can sense geological structures, weaknesses, tremors, and mineral deposits within miles.

Titan's Might: The wielder can channel Kaelgrin's strength. Their Strength score becomes 29. They can cause localized earthquakes (similar to the earthquake spell) once per week. They can animate stone to serve them, creating powerful earth elementals or stone guardians.

Zone of Telluric Stability: As an action, the wielder can designate a 1-mile radius area around the Core as a Zone of Stability for 24 hours. Within this zone, the Veil's chaotic effects are significantly dampened (disadvantage on Veil Corruption rolls, Veilstorms cannot form or enter). Natural healing is doubled, and plants grow with unnatural vigor. Maintaining this requires daily concentration and drains the wielder.

Dream of the Deep: By meditating with the Core, the wielder can enter Kaelgrin's dreams, potentially gleaning ancient knowledge about the world's formation, the titans, or even the location of other slumbering entities. This is perilous, as the dreams are alien and can strain sanity.

\column

Lore: This is not a crafted item but a natural focal point of Kaelgrin's immense, slumbering consciousness, formed deep within the roots of the Ashen Peaks. It is where his dreams coalesce into a tangible form. It was discovered by a community of his Earthwarden followers who were led to it by visions during a period of intense seismic activity. They guard it fiercely, believing it is the key to understanding their god's will and eventually, perhaps, guiding his gentle reawakening to heal the land. Others, especially those fearing the titans' return or those aligned with Theramach's more volatile elemental nature, might seek to destroy it or corrupt its power.

<br>

Drawbacks: The Resonant Core is immobile. The attuned wielder becomes increasingly slow, deliberate, and tied to the earth, finding it difficult to travel far from the Core or act with haste. They might begin to take on stone-like physical traits. Drawing too much power can cause violent, uncontrolled earthquakes or risk prematurely stirring Kaelgrin in a destructive manner. The wielder might become lost in Kaelgrin's dreams.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

The Shroud of Unmaking (The Veil's Scar)

Description: A tattered, impossibly vast cloak or shroud that seems to be woven from threads of pure darkness, shimmering chaotic light, and solidified nothingness. Its edges are indistinct, fading into and out of reality. The patterns upon it are never static, showing fleeting, terrifying glimpses of the raw void between planes, the inner workings of chaotic magic, and faces of entities that dwell in such places. It feels cold, not with a natural chill, but with the emptiness of true void. It whispers constantly in a multitude of alien tongues.

Powers (Attunement requires embracing a measure of chaos and surviving a direct, personal tear in the Veil, or a ritual that binds one's soul to its fabric):

Veil Walker: The wearer can become invisible at will and can step through thin points in the Veil (or create temporary rifts with great effort and risk) to travel short distances instantaneously, or even to adjacent planes (extremely dangerous and imprecise).

Unravel Magic: As an action, the wearer can attempt to unravel a magical effect or suppress the magic within an item. This requires a difficult ability check using their spellcasting ability contested by the effect's creator or the item's own power. Success can range from temporary suppression to permanent destruction of the magic.

Gaze of the Void: The wearer can pull back the Shroud to reveal a glimpse of the true void. Creatures who see this must make a high DC Wisdom saving throw or suffer effects ranging from short-term madness, fear, to permanent insanity or even dissolution of their being (DM's discretion based on creature power). The wearer is not immune to lesser effects of this.

Whispers of Chaos: The Shroud constantly feeds the wearer knowledge of chaotic magic, forbidden rituals, and the weaknesses of cosmic entities, granting them access to strange and potent abilities but eroding their sanity and moral compass.

\column

Lore: The Shroud of Unmaking is believed to be a literal fragment of the Veil that was so catastrophically torn during the Veilshatter Cataclysm that it became imbued with the essence of the outer void. It is less an item and more a mobile tear in reality, tenuously held together. It was first encountered in the deepest, most magically unstable part of the Shimmering Sands, its presence causing the perpetual Veilstorms there. Cults dedicated to chaos or entities from the void seek it to unravel Aelathar entirely. Nyraea's Weavekeepers and Voryx's Shardbound consider its destruction or absolute containment a priority of the highest order, but its very nature makes this nearly impossible.

<br>

Drawbacks: The wearer's mind is constantly exposed to the horrors and chaos of the void, leading to inevitable madness, paranoia, and transformation into something alien. The Shroud actively tries to corrupt the wearer and tempts them to unleash greater chaos. It attracts powerful, hostile extraplanar beings (demons, aberrations, entities of the void). Using its powers always risks widening the tear in the Veil it represents, causing localized disasters or attracting more immediate threats. The Shroud might eventually try to consume its wearer entirely.

Denizens of a Shattered World—The Bestiary of Aelathar
To the unwary traveler, every shadow in the Scorched Cradle may conceal a waiting doom, every whisper on the wind might be the sigh of something ancient and malevolent. The creatures of Aelathar are not mere beasts; they are living, breathing testaments to a world irrevocably broken and perpetually struggling for a semblance of existence. They are the children of desolation, the avatars of corrupted magic, and the echoes of a divine war that tore reality asunder.

<br>

In these pages, you will find a panoply of entities that roam the sun-baked wastes, haunt the volcanic peaks, stalk the razor-sharp plains of glass, and fester within the magically saturated Veiljungles. Many are creatures that, in other, healthier worlds, might have been familiar parts of the natural order. Here, however, they are twisted by generations of exposure to the raw, untamed energies of the fractured Veil. Their forms are often warped, their instincts sharpened by unending scarcity, and their very essence imbued with the chaotic magic that now chokes Aelathar. You will encounter beings born directly of Veil-tears, ephemeral horrors that embody the madness of the outer void, and monstrosities whose flesh has begun the terrible process of Crystallization, becoming living shards of dangerous magic.

<br>

Others are relics of a bygone age, remnants of the titanic struggles between Celestial Dragons and Elemental Titans, or guardians of ruins that whisper of the Verdant Harmony that was lost. Slumbering things stir beneath the sands, and ancient sentinels, their purpose long forgotten, still patrol forgotten tombs.

<br>

As Dungeon Master, the creatures detailed herein are more than mere adversaries. They are the embodiment of Aelathar's perils. Use them to challenge your players' courage and resourcefulness, to deepen the mystery of the world's past, and to underscore the constant, pressing threat of survival in the Scorched Cradle. Each encounter should serve as a reminder that Aelathar is a land that demands resilience, offers little comfort, and often rewards curiosity with a glimpse into the abyss.

Tread carefully, for the denizens of this shattered world are as desperate, as dangerous, and as deeply scarred as the land itself.

Veil Grub Swarm
A faint, sickly sweet smell and a low, chittering hum often precede the appearance of a Veil Grub Swarm. These creatures are not born in any natural sense but coalesce from organic detritus and raw Veil energy in places where the barrier between realities is particularly thin and fetid. Individually, a Veil Grub is barely a threat, a thumb-sized, pulsating larva that shimmers with faint, unnatural colors. In a swarm, however, their collective hunger and the chaotic energy they exude can overwhelm the unwary.

VEIL GRUB SWARM
Medium swarm of Tiny aberrations, Unaligned

Armor Class 12 (natural armor)
Hit Points 27 (6d8)
Speed 20 ft., burrow 10 ft.

STR	DEX	CON	INT	WIS	CHA

Senses Darkvision 60 ft., Tremorsense 30 ft., Passive Perception 8
Languages —
Challenge 1/2 (100 XP)
Proficiency Bonus +2

Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny grub. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

Veil Sickness Aura. Any creature that starts its turn in the swarm's space must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be afflicted by a mild, unsettling nausea. While afflicted, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell and cannot take reactions. This effect lasts until the start of the creature's next turn.

ACTIONS
Bites. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 7 (2d6) piercing damage, or 3 (1d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 2 (1d4) psychic damage from the disorienting touch of Veil energy.

\column

Veil-Twisted Mauler
The howl of a Veil-Twisted Mauler is a chilling sound, less an animalistic cry and more a discordant shriek that seems to bend the air around it. These once-natural desert predators—perhaps large wolves, hyenas, or some other pack hunter native to Aelathar's less blighted past—have been irrevocably warped by prolonged exposure to Veil energies, often from hunting too close to the Shimmering Sands or lairing near unstable rifts. Their forms are a horrifying parody of their original shapes, with limbs of unequal length, patches of raw, shimmering flesh, and bony spurs or crystalline growths jutting out at unnatural angles. They hunt with a terrifying blend of animal cunning and chaotic unpredictability.

<br>

VEIL-TWISTED MAULER
Large monstrosity, Chaotic Evil

Armor Class 14 (natural armor)
Hit Points 75 (10d10+20)
Speed 50 ft.

STR	DEX	CON	INT	WIS	CHA
17 (+3)	15 (+2)	14 (+2)	6 (-2)	13 (+1)	7 (-2)

Skills Perception +3, Stealth +4
Senses Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 13
Languages Understands Common but cannot speak
Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)
Proficiency Bonus +2

Unstable Form. The Mauler is wreathed in faint, shimmering chaotic energy. Attack rolls against it have disadvantage unless the attacker is within 5 feet of the Mauler. Additionally, any creature that touches the Mauler or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage.

Pack Tactics. The Mauler has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the Mauler's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

ACTIONS
Multiattack. The Mauler makes two attacks: one with its Warped Bite and one with its Crystalline Claw.

Warped Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the Mauler until the end of its next turn due to the bite's disorienting psychic impact.

Crystalline Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10+3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved until the end of its next turn as jagged, microscopic crystals temporarily impede its movement.

Veil Jaunt (Recharge 5–6). The Mauler momentarily tears the Veil, teleporting up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Each creature within 5 feet of the space it left and each creature within 5 feet of the space it appears in must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) force damage as reality briefly distorts.

Shard-Heart Desolator

Legends among wastelanders speak of the Shard-Heart Desolators with hushed terror, describing them as living Veilstorms given monstrous form. These colossal beings are the horrifying culmination of intense and prolonged Veil saturation, where a powerful creature or even a potent nexus of Veil energy itself achieves a terrifying, mobile sentience. Its body is a shifting mass of razor-sharp, Veil-infused crystals—often of obsidian, sickly amethyst, and other unsettling hues—that hum with immense, unstable power. Light refracts strangely through its form, and the air around it crackles with raw chaos. The "heart" of the Desolator is said to be a massive, pulsating Veilshard that draws in ambient magic and life force to sustain its destructive existence. It is less a creature of flesh and blood and more a sentient catastrophe, its passage leaving behind only scoured land and crystalline echoes of its victims.

<br>

SHARD-HEART DESOLATOR
Huge aberration, Chaotic Neutral (driven by instinct and the Veil's hunger)

Armor Class 17 (natural crystalline armor)
Hit Points 184 (16d12+80)
Speed 30 ft., burrow 20 ft. (can move through stone and crystal as if it were loose earth)

STR	DEX	CON	INT	WIS	CHA
22 (+6)	8 (-1)	20 (+5)	10 (+0)	14 (+2)	16 (+3)

Saving Throws Con +9, Wis +6
Damage Resistances Piercing, Slashing from nonmagical attacks
Damage Immunities Poison, Psychic
Condition Immunities Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned
Senses Darkvision 120 ft. (sees through magical and nonmagical darkness), Blindsight 60 ft. (can perceive Veil energy currents), Passive Perception 12
Languages Understands Primordial and telepathy 120 ft. (transmits images of chaos and hunger)
Challenge 11 (7,200 XP)
Proficiency Bonus +4

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the Desolator fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Aura of Dissonance. The area within 30 feet of the Desolator is warped by chaotic Veil energy. Any creature that starts its turn in this aura has its speed halved until the start of its next turn, and spell Ranged Attack rolls made by creatures in the aura have disadvantage. Furthermore, when a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher within the aura, it must roll a d20. On a 1, the spell fails, has no effect, and the caster must roll on Aelathar's Veil Corruption Table.

Crystalline Regeneration. The Desolator regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the Desolator takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn.

Magic Weapons. The Desolator's weapon attacks are magical.

ACTIONS
Multiattack. The Desolator makes two Shard Slam attacks.

Shard Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8+6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Crystallization Point (as per Aelathar's long-term magic effects).

Veil Rupture (Recharge 5–6). The Desolator unleashes a blast of raw chaotic energy from its core in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save by 5 or more is also stunned until the end of its next turn.

Summon Veil Echoes (1/Day). The Desolator summons 1d4 Veil-Twisted Maulers or 2d6 Veil Grub Swarms. Summoned creatures appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of the Desolator and act as its allies. They remain for 1 hour, until the Desolator dies, or until the Desolator dismisses them as a bonus action.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS
The Desolator can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Desolator regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Slam. The Desolator makes one Shard Slam attack.
Crystalline Shards (Costs 2 Actions). The Desolator launches a volley of razor-sharp crystals. Each creature of the Desolator's choice within 30 feet of it must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
Consume Magic (Costs 3 Actions). The Desolator targets one creature it can see within 60 feet that is concentrating on a spell. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or its concentration is broken, and the Desolator regains hit points equal to twice the level of the spell that was being concentrated on.

These should provide some uniquely Aelatharian threats for your players to encounter, directly tied to the corrupted magic and perilous nature of the Veil!

Shifting Mote

These curious and often unsettling apparitions are common in areas where the Veil is particularly thin or recently agitated, such as the Shimmering Sands or in the wake of a Veilstorm. A Shifting Mote appears as a roughly spherical conglomeration of dust, sand, and faintly glowing, multi-hued particles of raw Veil energy, no larger than a human head. They drift aimlessly, drawn to strong emotions or displays of magic. While not truly sentient in a way most understand, they react to their surroundings, and their touch can be disorienting and strangely chilling.

*Incorporeal Movement:* The mote can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

*Veil Resonance:* The mote emits a faint, barely perceptible hum. Creatures with an active spell effect on them or those concentrating on a spell that are within 10 feet of the mote feel a strange thrumming that is distracting; they have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells.

Actions
*Disorienting Touch:* Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d4+3) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or all attacks against it have advantage until the start of its next turn as its perception of its surroundings briefly warps.

Salt-Cryst Stalker

<br>

The Salt Wastes are a monument to the Cataclysm, and the very salt is infused with lingering, corrupting magic. The Salt-Cryst Stalker is a horrifying example of this fusion. Once perhaps a large desert reptile or predatory insect, generations of exposure have transformed it into a creature of crystalline salt and raw Veil energy. Its body glitters cruelly under the harsh sun, armored in jagged, salt-like plates that are harder than stone, and its eyes glow with a faint, sickly light. It hunts with patient, ambush tactics, its touch leeching moisture and its presence a harbinger of desiccation and creeping Veil-taint.

Challenge            :: 5 (1800 XP) {{bonus Proficiency Bonus +3}}

*Crystalline Hide:* When the stalker is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails, as projectiles and energies harmlessly deflect or are absorbed by its salt crystals.

*Desiccating Aura:* Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the Salt-Cryst Stalker must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion (to a maximum of 3 levels from this aura). This exhaustion is removed after the creature finishes a short or long rest in a place with ample water. Creatures that do not need to drink water are immune to this aura.

*Salt Strider:* The stalker ignores difficult terrain composed of sand, salt, or loose earth.

Actions
*Multiattack:* The Stalker makes two attacks: one with its Salt-Encrusted Bite and one with its Crystal Shard Claw.

*Salt-Encrusted Bite:* Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage as moisture is leached from its body.

*Crystal Shard Claw:* Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10+3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be afflicted with Veil Sickness for 1 minute. An afflicted creature is poisoned, and the casting time of any spell it casts is doubled. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

*Shard Volley (Recharge 5–6):* The Stalker launches a spray of razor-sharp salt crystals in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Veil-Whisperer Cultist
<br>

Not all who are touched by the Veil become mindless beasts or suffer obvious physical corruption. Some, through dark pacts, obsessive study, or sheer desperate willpower, manage to channel its chaotic energies, becoming Veil-Whisperer Cultists. 

These individuals, often former scholars, recluses, or desperate outcasts, believe the Veil holds keys to ultimate power, forbidden knowledge, or even a twisted form of salvation from Aelathar's harsh realities. 

They often bear subtle marks of their communion—eyes that flicker with an unnatural light, skin that is unusually cold or hums faintly with static, or whispers that seem to emanate from their shadow. 

They gather in secret cabals, often near places of Veil thinning, conducting strange rituals and seeking to deepen their connection, heedless of the cost to their sanity or the world around them.

Veil Attunement: The cultist has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened by magical effects originating from the Veil or aberrations. When the cultist casts a spell that deals psychic or force damage, it can add its Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

Whispers of Madness: As a bonus action, the cultist can target one creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be subjected to disorienting whispers from the Veil. On a failed save, the target can't take reactions and has disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check made before the end of its next turn.

Spellcasting: The cultist is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The cultist knows the following sorcerer spells:

Cantrips (at will): Chill touch, Mage hand, Message, Minor illusion, Ray of frost

1st level (4 slots): Dissonant whispers, Shield, Thunderwave

2nd level (3 slots): Blur, Crown of madness, Phantasmal force

3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, Hypnotic pattern, Whispering Rift 

4th level (2 slots): Banishment, Veil Incursion


Actions
Dagger of Veilwarding (Magical Dagger): 

Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage. 

A creature hit by this attack must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or believe the next illusion it sees created by the cultist in the next minute, provided the illusion is plausible.

Invoke Veil's Wrath (1/Day): The cultist calls upon the raw power of the Veil. Each creature of the cultist's choice within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the cultist. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed. After using this action, the cultist must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion and roll on Aelathar's Veil Corruption Table.

Aelathar

THE SCORCHED CRADLE AWAITS YOUR TALE...

<br>

The last grain of sand has fallen through the hourglass, yet the story of Aelathar is far from over. It is a saga etched in scarred landscapes and the desperate courage of those who call this broken world home. What role will you play in its next, uncertain chapter?

<br>

WILL YOU DARE TO:

Walk the Salt Wastes where mirages whisper lies and ancient magic festers beneath the crystalline crust?
Uncover the secrets of the Black Spire, delving into lore that shattered a world and could unravel your sanity?

Navigate the treacherous politics of Korrath's iron law and Zyndralis's veiled ambitions, where trust is a scarcer commodity than water?
Brave the Veilstorms, not as a victim, but as a master of their chaotic energies, or perhaps their next sacrifice?

Wield the perilous gift of Veil magic, knowing each incantation frays the barrier between realities and risks the dread touch of Crystallization?
Seek out the lost legacies of Celestial Dragon and Elemental Titan, and decide whether their ancient war truly ended, or merely sleeps?

Befriend the ostracized Stone-Scales or the enigmatic Veilkin, understanding the unique burdens and strengths forged in Aelathar’s harsh embrace?

Confront the Shard-Heart Desolators and other horrors born of the Veil, or delve deeper to understand the source of their sorrowful rage?

Quest for artifacts of unimaginable power, like the Shroud of Unmaking, and choose whether to destroy them, hide them, or claim their terrible might?

<br>

Aelathar offers no easy paths, no certain victories. Only the biting winds, the oppressive sun, the whispered promises of forgotten gods, and the constant, thrilling peril of a world where magic itself is a double-edged gift.

<br>

Your legend begins in the dust and embers.
<br>
What will they say of you when the Veilstorms clear?

Aelathar-Specific Spells and abilities
(These spells are unique to the Aelathar campaign setting and may be learned by player characters (typically Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards, unless otherwise noted) through discovery of ancient texts, tutelage from unique masters, or other means determined by the Dungeon Master. Some are also utilized by specific NPCs or creatures within the world.)

<br>


Crystalline Shard Ward
1st-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
Effect: When an attack would hit you or you are targeted by the magic missile spell, you can momentarily draw upon the ambient Veil energy to crystallize the air around you into a shimmering, defensive lattice. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +5 bonus to your AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile. The crystalline lattice shatters harmlessly after protecting you or when the spell ends.
Aelathar Lore & Connection: A common reactive defense taught in Zyndralis and sometimes independently discovered. It's a minor manipulation of the energies that lead to Crystallization, but in a controlled, fleeting burst.

Primary Users: Arcane spellcasters (player characters, NPCs).

<br>

Unraveling Blast
3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a frayed silken cord that unravels when the spell is cast)
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: You unleash a volatile bolt of chaotic Veil energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 force damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer a minor, random Veil-warping effect until the end of your next turn. Roll a d4 to determine the effect:
Sensory Scramble: The target has disadvantage on attack rolls.

Whispering Rift
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a shard of obsidian and a dessicated moth wing)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Effect: You tear open a temporary, localized rift into the unsettling fringes of the Veil, creating a 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling, intangible shadows and disembodied, maddening whispers at a point you can see within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. When the sphere appears, or when a creature enters its area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 psychic damage and becomes frightened of the sphere's area until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not frightened. The sphere's area is difficult terrain. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If it moves into a space occupied by a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's psychic damage and fear effect.
Aelathar Lore & Connection: Used by those who draw power from the Veil's unsettling aspects, like Veil-Whisperer Cultists, to control areas and unnerve opponents.

Primary Users: Arcane spellcasters (player characters, NPCs), Veil-Whisperer Cultists.

Veil Incursion
4th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: You attempt to tear a minuscule, momentary rift into the target's perception, flooding their mind with the disorienting, cacophonous unreality that seethes beyond the Veil. Choose one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d8 psychic damage as its mind reels from the sensory overload, and it is afflicted by Veil Shock until the end of your next turn. While suffering Veil Shock: the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls; it has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks; and its speed is halved. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no additional effects.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
Aelathar Lore & Connection: Developed by those who have peered too deeply into the Veil, forcing a victim to perceive raw chaos.

Primary Users: Arcane spellcasters (player characters, NPCs), Veil-Whisperer Cultists.

Conjure Veil Echo
5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a shard of obsidian from the Black Spire or a handful of sand from the Shimmering Sands)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Effect: You tear a small hole in the Veil, calling forth a creature of chaotic energy. Choose to summon: one Veil-Twisted Mauler, two Salt-Cryst Stalkers, four Veil Grub Swarms, or eight Shifting Motes. Summoned creatures appear in unoccupied spaces you can see, are allied to you, share your initiative (acting after you), and obey your verbal commands. If concentration is broken, you lose control, the creature becomes hostile, and disappears 1 hour after being summoned. Upon completing the casting, you must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you gain one level of exhaustion and must immediately roll on the Veil Corruption Table.
Aelathar Lore & Connection: A dangerous spell summoning constructs of Veil energy and Aelatharian essence, viewed with extreme caution.

Primary Users: Arcane spellcasters (player characters, NPCs willing to take the risk).

Zone of Unmaking
7th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of glass from the Glass Expanse that shatters, and a tear shed in sorrow)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Effect: Creates a 30-foot-radius sphere of dangerously thinned Veil energy. Creatures in the area or entering it make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d10 force damage on a fail (half on success). This save is repeated if ending turn there. The area is difficult terrain. Any creature casting a spell (1st level or higher slot) within the zone must first succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or the spell fails, the slot is consumed, the caster takes 2d10 psychic damage, and rolls on the Veil Corruption Table.
Aelathar Lore & Connection: Creates a localized pocket of chaotic energy reminiscent of the Veilshatter Cataclysm. Considered exceptionally dangerous.

Primary Users: Powerful and often reckless/desperate arcane spellcasters (player characters, high-level NPCs).

<br>

Veilrend Cascade
9th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (150-foot cone)
Components: V, S, M (the petrified heart of a creature that died in a Veilstorm, which crumbles to dust)
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Unleashes a torrent of raw, unmaking energy. Each creature in a 150-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 force damage and 10d8 psychic damage on a failed save (half on success). Creatures reduced to 0 HP are disintegrated. The landscape in the cone is permanently scarred into difficult terrain.
The Cost of Power: Immediately after casting, you take 10d6 irreducible psychic damage, gain three levels of exhaustion, roll twice on the Veil Corruption Table (suffering both effects, intensified if duplicated), and there's a 50% chance a permanent, localized Veil tear opens within the cone.
Aelathar Lore & Connection: The closest a mortal can come to replicating the Veilshatter Cataclysm. Apocalyptic magic with devastating personal and environmental costs.

Primary Users: Only the most powerful, desperate, or hubristic arcane spellcasters (archvillains, perhaps a desperate player character in an ultimate sacrifice).

Easy Challenge: Obsidian Shardmite
These small, predatory constructs or elementals are native to the Glass Expanse, perfectly camouflaged among its myriad dangers. When inactive or hunting, an Obsidian Shardmite flattens its body or compresses its form to resemble a jagged, fist-sized obsidian stalagmite or a sharp chunk of debris common on the deadly plains. Only when prey wanders too close, or when disturbed, does it reveal its true, multi-faceted, insectoid form, skittering forth on razor-sharp legs to slice with its obsidian limbs. They are often encountered in small, skittering groups.

False Appearance (Inactive Form). While the Shardmite remains motionless in its inactive form (resembling an obsidian shard or stalagmite), it is indistinguishable from an ordinary piece of obsidian. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky or obsidian terrain.

Glass Walker. The Shardmite can move across difficult terrain made of glass, obsidian shards, or sharp rocks without expending extra movement.

ACTIONS
Obsidian Stab. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.

Splintering Burst (Recharge 6). As an action, or as a reaction when it takes damage, the Shardmite can explosively release a hail of tiny obsidian splinters. Each creature within a 5-foot radius of the Shardmite must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Medium-Hard Challenge: Obsidian Flayer
The Obsidian Flayer is a terrifying hunter of the Glass Expanse, a creature seemingly sculpted from the Expanse’s deadliest essence. It moves with an unnatural grace across the razor plains, its body a nightmarish fusion of jagged obsidian plates, sharpened limbs, and reflective surfaces that catch the grim Aelatharian light in disorienting ways. It is said that Flayers are born from areas where the magical energies that created the Glass Expanse still resonate strongly, coalescing into sentient, predatory forms. They are territorial, patient, and exceptionally cruel in their methods of dispatching prey, often using the environment itself as a weapon.

Glass Strider. The Obsidian Flayer ignores difficult terrain made of glass, obsidian shards, or sharp rocks. It can also move up, down, and across vertical obsidian surfaces and upside down along obsidian ceilings, while leaving its hands free. It has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed on such surfaces.

Reflective Defense. Ranged attacks made against the Flayer from more than 30 feet away have disadvantage due to the disorienting reflections from its obsidian hide.

Siege Monster (Obsidian Strikes). The Flayer deals double damage to objects and structures with its obsidian melee attacks. (This is an adaptation of the SRD Siege Monster trait.)

ACTIONS
Multiattack. The Flayer makes two attacks: one with its Obsidian Claw and one with its Shard Whip.

Obsidian Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elemental or construct, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or lose 1d4 hit points at the start of each of its turns due to deep, bleeding obsidian cuts. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

Shard Whip. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet straight toward the Flayer.

Razor Shard Field (Recharge 5–6). The Obsidian Flayer causes the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on itself to erupt with jagged obsidian shards. This area is difficult terrain and lasts for 1 minute or until the Flayer uses this action again. When a creature moves into or within the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make this saving throw.
